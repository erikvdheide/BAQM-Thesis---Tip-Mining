55	601	B00003TL7P	A1O90WPVWSN7C0	Baby	2	This pail doesnt really keep in odors anymore and well probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.	0.0					48

76	605	B000046S3W	A2O30DLTXMOZN5	Baby	1	I gave this product 4/5 stars for a couple reasons:Pros - mostly keeps fingers away from the plugs and sockets but only because they cant reach the sockets with little fingers, durable, hard for a child to take apart, completely kept our first son away.	0.0					44
77	605	B000046S3W	A2O30DLTXMOZN5	Baby	2	Cons - harder for an adult to quickly put together and take apart, doesnt keep little extremely curious fingers out of the top hole area (though they cant reach the part that would shock them), and doesnt stop our son from unplugging the cord since there is space for the cord to be pulled upward so that the plug comes out of the socket.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		63
78	605	B000046S3W	A2O30DLTXMOZN5	Baby	3	The plug wont come out of the box easily, but it can still be unplugged, and since its harder for an adult to get fingers in the top part to plug it back in, it has to be taken apart to be plugged back in.	0.0					45
79	605	B000046S3W	A2O30DLTXMOZN5	Baby	4	Overall, its done the job very well, but it is big and isnt perfect (though I doubt anything is).	0.0					19

84	607	B0000482FN	A3MLCCF9US8KDB	Baby	3	The directions were also unclear and the picture doesnt match the product.	0.0					12
85	608	B0000488W1	A2BXRSNO3OVFV3	Baby	1	These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly.	0.0					17

92	609	B0000488W2	A3JEFPEUXUS0I	Baby	2	Its not super easy to install (each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door).	0.0					16
93	609	B0000488W2	A3JEFPEUXUS0I	Baby	3	If you take your time, ready the instructions, plan it out, and execute; it works great.	0.0					16

97	609	B0000488W2	A3JEFPEUXUS0I	Baby	7	I think it wont work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		20
98	609	B0000488W2	A3JEFPEUXUS0I	Baby	8	I love how its hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it.	0.0					17
99	609	B0000488W2	A3JEFPEUXUS0I	Baby	9	The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time.	0.0					18
100	610	B00004C8S8	A1G8P53Z80XJEA	Baby	1	I am sure we will use these in the future, but I wanted to post saying that our doctor recommended an emery board to avoid the risk of cutting the skin of a newborn because their nails are so close to it.	0.0					42

122	613	B00004D3EU	A1ZFEN9RTB58OD	Baby	3	Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning.	0.0					32
123	613	B00004D3EU	A1ZFEN9RTB58OD	Baby	4	Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time.	0.0					21

2731	4929	B000EMRJRQ	A3ATCOLQQ6FOGT	Baby	7	Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when hes eating, Id look elsewhere.	0.0					32

11129	10711	B003YHUVH8	A2KV49MJS6W4DQ	Baby	3	First, the plastic is stiff and does not drape over my baby at all, which means that it slides around all the time and food gets in under and around it.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		31

11131	10711	B003YHUVH8	A2KV49MJS6W4DQ	Baby	5	Third, the pocket is pretty much flush with the bib and therefore doesnt catch much.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		15

11133	10711	B003YHUVH8	A2KV49MJS6W4DQ	Baby	7	Fifth, although waterproof plastic may seem like a good idea, in fact liquids just rolled straight down the bib and onto babys lap.	0.0					23
11134	10711	B003YHUVH8	A2KV49MJS6W4DQ	Baby	8	For someone looking for a bib I would recommend a soft cloth bib with waterproof plasticized backing in a large size or a bib with sleeves.	0.0					26

11148	10714	B003YLEU1M	APUIDDJ31OC0E	Baby	14	First of all, you have to make sure the bottom is screwed on **REALLY** tight, otherwise the water used to heat will mix with the contents of the bottle.	1.0	Usage	no	after		29

11150	10714	B003YLEU1M	APUIDDJ31OC0E	Baby	16	This extra thick, screw-on bottom makes warming the contents extra long compared to other bottles, such as Avent.	0.0					17
11151	10714	B003YLEU1M	APUIDDJ31OC0E	Baby	17	Once you finally do get the milk warmed and take the MAM bottle out of the hot water, you have to be very careful not to burn yourself or your baby with the steaming water that collected in that screw-on bottom through the vent holes.	1.0	Warning	no	after		44
11152	10714	B003YLEU1M	APUIDDJ31OC0E	Baby	18	Banging it out doesnt get all of it and makes too much noise for all those night time feedings or anytime for that matter.	0.0				after	24

11220	10726	B003ZO072Y	AF7GUS0C7KL14	Baby	11	But it has so much space that for my 18 hour flight, I packed 2 sleep n plays,  3 onesies, one baby einstein take-a-long tunes, 10 - 12 size 2 diapers, 2 packs of wipes,the transparent dirty duds pouch filled with his eczema lotion, vaseline, our tooth paste and lotion (travel size), 2 -3 bottles infant formula (individual liquid serving bottles, just in case) and a full sized baby blanket and it all fit (although the bag was bulging, but do you blame it?:D).	0.0					75
11221	10726	B003ZO072Y	AF7GUS0C7KL14	Baby	12	And to top it all, it survived the wear-and-tear of travel very well and now I use it everyday instead of my Vera Bradley bag because I find it just so convenient and spacious.	0.0					33
11222	10727	B003ZUXQVW	ARSUPKMDMVRHN	Baby	1	This diaper stacker is a little more expensive than others, but I chose it because it was the only one I could find that held wipes AND could be hung up.	0.0					31

13700	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	2	When I saw the reviews on this product I immediately ordered it and paid for expedited shipping.	0.0					17
13701	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	3	We used it the night we received it and it worked.	0.0					11
13702	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	4	We decided to only use it if she was really upset and ask the pediatrician the next week about it.	0.0					20
13703	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	5	When we talked to her she discouraged the use of any anal stimulant products as many babies have what is called grunting baby syndrome -  basically she didnt know how to relax her muscles to allow the gas / poop out yet and by using the windi  it was triggering a reflex (could be triggered by anal thermometer or cotton ball also)  that relaxed the muscle.	0.0					64
13704	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	6	But if the parent does this then the baby doesnt learn how to relax the muscle themselves and you end up having to stimulate it everytime thus delaying the babys learning.	0.0					31
13705	11981	B005IGTTIA	A5S2GFUIUJ0VW	Baby	7	We never used it again and she figured out how to pass gas/poop on her own a couple weeks later.	0.0					19

13729	11988	B005IWM8I2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Baby	12	My real gripe, though, is the fact that the swing is a little fast even on the slowest setting.	1.0	Usage	yes	after		19
13730	11988	B005IWM8I2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Baby	13	I really wish it could go a little slower because the speed seems to excite baby rather than make her want go to sleep, which is really what I wanted a swing for.	0.0				after	33
