1081	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	5	Less waste - you adhere a piece to the face of your sanding block, and dont have to wrap any paper around the sides.	0.0					23
1082	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	6	Result - you use 100% of the paper for sanding2.	0.0					7
1083	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	7	For precise sanding, stick a piece of this paper at the very edge/corner/whatever of a sanding block, and you use the straight edge to get into tight corners, etc.3.	1.0	Usage	yes	after		27

1086	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	10	Then, for small pieces, use both hands to slide the piece back and forth over the flat (and immobile) sandpaper.	0.0				after	20
1087	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	11	Hint: cut a piece or two of the paper and adhere to the top side of the piece you are sanding.	1.0	Usage	no	after		21
1088	403	B0000223SK	A3B63RR2GS9DEO	Tools & Home Improvement	12	This gives you great grip on the top as you slide the piece back and forth over the horizontal paper.	0.0				after	20

2601	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	12	The steps I have revised are in order below:1.	0.0					8
2602	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	13	(Per pictures on saw)--Pull up the black plastic knob on the forward/top part of the handle to the FULLEST upright position.2. 	0.0					20
2603	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	14	--Turn knob a minimum of three revolutions counterclockwise (I make four turns which I find makes blade insertion easier)3. 	0.0					19

2606	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	18	(NOT ADDRESSED IN SIX STEPS)--Next, PULL BLADE DOWN to seat it properly into reciprocating plunger.	0.0					16
2607	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	19	This should automatically align it parallel to the body of the saw and should address concerns of misaligned blades.	0.0					19
2608	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	20	Note: This knob WILL lock the blade out of alignment if you bypass this step and make cutting difficult if not impossible depending on how far out of alignment you chose to lock it in.	0.0					35

2612	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	27	Another tip that I find useful, although not absolutely necessary is to push the plunger (reciprocating shaft) into the fullest upright position before blade insertion/removal.	1.0	Workaround	yes	after		24
2613	645	B00004S90L	A2MW5O8JHDH3AW	Tools & Home Improvement	28	This makes the procedure much easier, particularly on the finger tips when using new, sharp more aggressive blades.	0.0					18

3731	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	3	The longer nose decreased the angle between the handle and the chuck so that the  drill can be pointed in a tight area without the handle and/or battery hitting an obstacle.	0.0					30
3732	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	4	Of course, you can get extension pieces for driving screws and some bits, so the longer nose is probably a minor point.	0.0					22
3733	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	5	But without such attachments, the longer nose and reversible battery (which is a feature of both hammer and non-hammer drill models) allow the hammer-drill version to access tight areas where the handle/battery would interfere a little better.	0.0					34
3734	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	6	On the downside, the longer nose increases drills overall length, making it more difficult to insert into tight areas where the drills motor & chuck length is the limiting factor.	0.0					29
3735	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	7	I compared this drill to the 14.4 volt Bosch Brute Tough drill, and I preferred the higher rpms that Milwaukee offered.	0.0					20
3736	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	8	Bosch has a better warranty on its battery (1.5 years compared to Milwaukees 1 year), but Milwaukees lifetime warranty on the drill beat Boschs 3 year warranty.	0.0					24
3737	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	9	Although I was impressed by Boschs durability claims, I found many similar testimonials on the Milwaukee website that attest to their drills toughness (stories of people dropping them from heights or driving over them with construction equipment).	0.0					37
3738	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	10	The Bosch drills case had a compartment to hold Bosch drill bit cases-you just snap them into the space provided.	0.0					19
3739	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	11	Although the Bosch kit included a screwdriver bit holder and small metal ring attached to the back of the drill, I found the removable side handle included in the Milwaukee kit a more useful option.	0.0					35
3740	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	12	If you want to tether the Milwaukee drill like the Bosch, there is a small ring built into the lower back of the Milwaukee drills handle that can accommodate a tether.	0.0					31

3752	1247	B0000789HU	A3JYDD8A4J2CH7	Tools & Home Improvement	24	Its a really good choice for medium duty drilling and driving tasks, but it didnt compare to the power of an 18 volt or corded drill when drilling 1.5 inch holes through 1 inch compressed particle board with a somewhat dull hole saw bit.	0.0					41

5130	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	3	If you go with this, there are FOUR things you MUST do.	0.0					12
5131	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	4	First, install a leakage catch basin.	0.0					6
5132	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	5	This is NOT OPTIONAL with ANY MINI TANK HEATER.	0.0					9
5133	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	6	There is a high likelihood that this one, in particular, will leak (read the reviews), and the result will be ruined cabinets and possibly mold growth.	0.0					26
5134	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	7	Even if your TANK is well maintained and in good shape, these can leak at the fittings and also at the gasket that seals the heating element.	0.0					27
5135	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	8	Dont want to do install a catch basin or dont have space?	0.0					12
5136	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	9	Then dont install this under your sink.	0.0					7
5137	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	10	You will regret it if you ignore this advice!	0.0					9
5138	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	11	The second thing is, plumb the T&P; (safety valve) so that it routes the water somewhere that wont do any damage.	0.0					22
5139	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	12	Again, T&Ps; DO VENT and sometimes they go bad and seep.	0.0					12
5140	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	13	Again, this will cause damage.	0.0					5
5141	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	14	You can connect it to the drain (use the proper connections, not expensive) but in most areas, THIS IS AGAINST CODE, as you are required to install so that you can see water coming out of the T&P; outlet (although it can be routed somewhere else).	0.0					47
5142	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	15	So connect to the drain at your own risk.	0.0					9
5143	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	16	The third thing is, you MUST check the T&P; every few months.	0.0					13
5144	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	17	Most people are very lax about checking the T&P; on their main water heater.	0.0					15
5145	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	18	Well, this one is in the house, and a tank water heater is potentially a bomb under your sink.	0.0					19
5146	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	19	Dont be a fool.... check the T&P;!!!	0.0					8
5147	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	20	Finally, MAINTAIN THE ANODE ROD.	0.0					5
5148	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	21	This brand requires it at least once a year and possibly every 6 months.	0.0					13
5149	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	22	It is a pain.	0.0					4
5150	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	23	If you dont change the rod, your tank will rust and leak and you will have to replace the unit.	0.0					20
5151	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	24	To change the anode, you have to pull the entire heater element.	0.0					12
5152	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	25	This means that you disturb the rubber gasket, and on this unit, that gasket is a source of leaks.	0.0					19
5153	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	26	Stupid design!!	0.0					2
5154	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	27	Probably a good idea to replace the gasket each time you change the rod, and check carefully after doing the job to make sure its not leaking (check it when hot and thus under high pressure).	0.0					36
5155	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	28	At least you will have installed the catch basin so your cabinet and kitchen flooring wont be ruined.	0.0					18
5156	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	29	Personally, I would use a different brand, such as a Rheem, which has less problems, but in my case I dont have the space and this %^&$# thing is the only one that fits.	0.0					33
5157	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	30	Unless you have a 220V circuit under the sink already (or can easily install it) I would NOT use a tankless.	0.0					20
5158	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	31	The 120V tankless units dont heat the water enough unless you restrict the flow to the faucet.	0.0					16
5159	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	32	Good luck with it!	0.0					4
5160	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	33	When this is working, it does work wonderfully.	0.0					8
5161	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	34	Most of my advice applies to ANY tank type heater.	0.0					10
5162	4053	B0006GVO1C	A3PQTLORUKTSQU	Tools & Home Improvement	35	But this one would get more stars if the heater came with a catch basin (since its always needed) and didnt require the annoyingly frequent anode rod replacement - or at least was easier to change.	0.0					35
5163	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	1	This mini-tank water heater works very well and we love not having to wait for hot water at the kitchen sink.	0.0					20
5164	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	2	The form-factor is also very convenient for mounting under the kitchen sink, unlike some other small point-of-use water heaters.	0.0					17
5165	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	3	I have this hooked up inline with a gas tankless water heater and I wanted to know how much this new heater was costing me in electricity, so I hooked up a meter to check it out for a few weeks.	0.0					41
5166	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	4	It turns out that, with our normal usage, it uses just about 5 KWH/week - which works out to about $2/month in our area.	0.0					20
5167	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	5	Before this heater, we had to run a full 2 gallons of water down the drain before getting hot water to the sink - which was both a big pain and somewhat wasteful.	0.0					31
5168	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	6	With this 4 gallon heater, we basically have an instant and endless supply of hot water at the sink since the hot water from the main tankless unit arrives before the water cools too noticeably.	0.0					34
5169	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	7	Ive also noticed that it seems to heat water on its own very quickly.	0.0					14
5170	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	8	The biggest problem with this water heater is how much of a pain it is to set the thermostat.	0.0					19
5171	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	9	You basically have to remove 3 panels and then turn a dial that isnt labeled at all.	0.0					16
5172	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	10	In order to get it set to the same temperature as my main water heater, I ended up using an instant-read thermometer and moving the thermostat dial as I filled the tank with cold water and let it reheat it to the set temp.	0.0					43
5173	4054	B0006GVO1C	ATFBVUXDIRXT6	Tools & Home Improvement	11	The process took a while, but I shouldnt have to do that again.	0.0					13

6761	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	79	However I need to correct and clearify a few things.	0.0					10
6762	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	80	First, about the physical capabilities of this unit.	0.0					8
6763	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	81	It IS capable of working with Hybrid-split systems (that is to say with modern gas furnace-heat pump combos) as well as boilers / fanless hot water systems.	0.0					24

6766	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	84	These use two wires each for either OR both heating and cooling.	0.0					12
6767	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	85	So for instance if you believe you have two stage heating youre old stat should have connections labeled W1 and W2 as apposed to a standard furnace having just W.	0.0					28
6768	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	86	If you have two stage cooling, you will likely have Y1 and Y2 as apposed to just Y.	0.0					16
6769	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	87	These systems are pretty uncommon but I thought I would add this in case you are a person looking for a replacement thermostat for such a system.	0.0					27
6770	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	88	However if you are certain you have a two stage heating or cooling system and it does not have mulitple wires for the side of the system that is multistage, contact the manufacturer.	0.0					33
6771	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	89	To give a little carity I will include the connections that MOST standard gas furnace and A/C combos will use.	0.0					19
6772	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	90	RH (or just R) and RC, generally these use a common (same) wire and most replacement thermostats have a preinstalled jumper (this one does as well.	0.0					26

6779	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	97	Also, if youre using a heat pump instead of a gas furnace, you will likely have an O or a B wire inplace of a W.	0.0					26
6780	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	98	A couple of other things.	0.0					5
6781	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	99	As I mensioned this thermostat has an automatic change over feature to allow it to switch between heating and cooling modes automatically.	0.0					22
6782	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	100	If used, this feature will make the system pretty much hands free requiring almost no user input at all beyond setting the temps.	0.0					23
6783	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	101	As I mensioned above there is a 3 degree seperation required by the thermostat.	0.0					13
6784	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	102	I wasnt sure what this was but after re-reading the instructions basically it amounts to simply requiring that the heat temp setting is a minimum of 3 degrees below the cool temp setting.	0.0					31
6785	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	103	So if you have youre cool temperature set to 72, and the closest youre heat setting can be is 69.	0.0					18
6786	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	104	If you turn up the heat setting to 70, it will bump the cool setting to 73.	0.0					15
6787	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	105	However theres nothing stopping you from having a much more realistic 5 or even 10 degree gap between them.	0.0					17
6788	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	106	Basically if the temp rises above the cool setting the A/C kicks on, if it drops below the heat setting the furnace (or heat pump) turns on, if the temp is in between the two the system sits idle.	0.0					38
6789	4970	B000EW80Q0	A3GT2EWQSO45ZG	Tools & Home Improvement	107	I hope this carifys any confusion I migt have created with my original review.	0.0					14

8151	5818	B000MG70PA	A2ROZACRW31PC2	Tools & Home Improvement	10	However this is not as convenient as a true push-type switch.- This flashlight is NOT FOCUSABLE - the lens is fixed and does NOT twist to focus.- There is no lanyard or hand strap included, although there is a hole for one.- The shape is not anti-roll so the flashlight could roll away from you.- There is no clip (even though it COULD fit in a shirt pocket).	0.0					61

10269	7396	B0017166N6	A1TYNLIAEDURP0	Tools & Home Improvement	5	I soon figured that the light reflecting off of the tile floor caused the light sensor to turn the LED lights off.	0.0					22

10274	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	1	Im not sure if this drill adapter is just perfectly balanced or what, but unlike theDEWALT DW0521 Quick Connect Impact Driver Conversion ChuckI tried, this adapter has almost no wobble in most orientations.	0.0					32
10275	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	2	If you run with the drill bit pointed straight up it will wobble about 3mm due to the inherent looseness of the hex socket of a driver, but in horizontal or at most other angles, and at most speeds, the adapter seems to be constantly pulled down by gravity and the tip of the drill bit moves by less than 1mm.	0.0					59
10276	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	3	I was able to use the Hitachi with a 1/4 bit to drill an accurate hole whereas the wobble generated by the DeWalt adapter caused splintering and a hole off center from the pilot hole.	0.0					34

10278	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	5	Of course it may just be luck of the draw if you get a perfectly balanced adapter or one that wobbles, but since the Hitachi is stamped as made in Germany my money is on the Hitachi for most likely to be balanced.	0.0					43

10280	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	7	The project Im working on requires switching between two different bit sizes a lot so being able to quickly swap bit adapters in a driver is just too useful.	0.0					29
10281	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	8	The manual says youre supposed to tighten the chuck until it clicks at least once.	0.0					15
10282	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	9	It usually takes a lot of force to make it click (seems a bit random - sometimes I can get 2-3 clicks before its too hard to turn further).	0.0					27
10283	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	10	The manual doesnt say what the clicking means but Im guessing its sort of a spring-loaded grip of some sort because Ive never had a drill bit come loose after I got it to click.	0.0					34

10285	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	12	One advantage the DeWalt chuck has over Hitachi is the single-handed tightening system that uses the rotation of the drill to tighten the chuck while you hold it still.	0.0					28
10286	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	13	When its fully tightened, the chuck starts ratcheting (clicking).	0.0					9
10287	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	14	This is not the same sort of clicking as on the Hitachi because it will just keep clicking as the drill spins whereas the Hitachi becomes harder to turn with each click.	0.0					32
10288	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	15	Personally I dont like the DeWalt ratcheting feature because, as some reviews have complained, if the ratcheting element in the chuck breaks or wears down the chuck wont tighten enough to hold the drill bit securely and the ratcheting limits how tight you can make it.	0.0					46
10289	7397	B001717COS	A30UFXOF0GS9NM	Tools & Home Improvement	16	The Hitachi requires two hands and a lot of force to tighten but it doesnt loosen.	0.0					16

11210	8199	B001GYVANK	A33TXOBERAPUGE	Tools & Home Improvement	17	On this lathe the screw is rounded so it doesnt grip very well and dimpling or drilling out very slightly the center should take care of it.	1.0	Usage	yes	after		27

13554	10149	B003ARSYR6	A2L46U9X378VKP	Tools & Home Improvement	21	Keeping the jig away from the blade guard means that more of the workpiece sticks out and I think leads to additional instability.	0.0					23

15309	11515	B004SNIIAY	A178FYDM3K4TE8	Tools & Home Improvement	2	First off, these stones are fast cutting, and put a good utility edge on every knife I have tried them on.	0.0					21
15310	11515	B004SNIIAY	A178FYDM3K4TE8	Tools & Home Improvement	3	The grit seems to have some edges quite a bit higher than the surface (relatively speaking) because if you are not very careful, you can scratch up the blade with them.	0.0					31

15315	11515	B004SNIIAY	A178FYDM3K4TE8	Tools & Home Improvement	8	However, to get a truly sharp edge, as in shaving sharp, you will need to follow up with something finer.	0.0					20

15318	11515	B004SNIIAY	A178FYDM3K4TE8	Tools & Home Improvement	11	This is a minor quibble, because a thicker stone, would take up more storage space, and it really isnt that hard to either place them at the edge of a work surface, or on top of some kind of spacer.	0.0					40

15644	11709	B0050EJBQ0	A3U5VP06Q1W4DB	Tools & Home Improvement	9	I also used this opportunity to replace the water shut off to the toilet, the old shut off started leaking as soon as I tried to turn it off.	0.0					29
15645	11709	B0050EJBQ0	A3U5VP06Q1W4DB	Tools & Home Improvement	10	SECOND, you need a 115 volt, 15 amp electrical supply (very) near the toilet.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		12

15648	11709	B0050EJBQ0	A3U5VP06Q1W4DB	Tools & Home Improvement	13	I gave it a new dedicated 15 amp circuit.	0.0					8
15649	11709	B0050EJBQ0	A3U5VP06Q1W4DB	Tools & Home Improvement	14	(This step is way easier to do this once the old toilet was removed and out of the way)With the new water shut off, toilet and outlet installed, placing the new seat and hooking it up were almost trivial.	0.0					40

15889	11770	B0052TZCE8	A39NB225G8LYPY	Tools & Home Improvement	16	It has two self-store slots for the screwdriver bits, whereas the screwdriver bit for the Bosch simply sits in the bottom of the case, and is almost guaranteed to get lost if you dont have a case for your bits.	0.0					39
15890	11770	B0052TZCE8	A39NB225G8LYPY	Tools & Home Improvement	17	The Craftsman also has two leveling bubbles -- one on the top and one on the back -- so if you want a perfectly horizontal or vertical hole, you are more likely to get it with the Craftsman.	0.0					36
15891	11770	B0052TZCE8	A39NB225G8LYPY	Tools & Home Improvement	18	On the whole, I recommend the Bosch  over the Craftsman for its extra power, good work light longer battery life and convenience of use.	0.0					24
