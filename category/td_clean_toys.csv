863	124	1616617047	A3GLIBRI4MDQ1I	Toys & Games	11	This new title allows the ship to carry over all unused focus tokens, allowing you to stack up piles of focus tokens for future rounds.	0.0					25

6860	8728	B001TK3LUG	A28E692X2JEEDZ	Toys & Games	7	As for the cons of the robot mode, I do agree with most criticisms: the left arm looks horribly shriveled up, while his right arm is basically a huge non-articulated cannon with a flip-out sword feature.	0.0					34
6861	8728	B001TK3LUG	A28E692X2JEEDZ	Toys & Games	8	But in person this doesnt look AS bad as you might think, and if you pose Megatron the right way it doesnt look half bad; I think the skinny arm was limited because of the way it has to fold in alt mode.	0.0					43

6867	8728	B001TK3LUG	A28E692X2JEEDZ	Toys & Games	14	Its not as sturdy as the robot mode, and the tracks dont function (as previously mentioned) so it rolls on small wheels that are embedded in the faux tracks.	0.0					29
6868	8728	B001TK3LUG	A28E692X2JEEDZ	Toys & Games	15	But it looks pretty movie accurate, and I know some people have complained that you can see Megatrons face in plain sight at the front of the tank, but if you watch ROTF and hit pause when he transforms into the tank, you can clearly see that his face DOES poke out, so I think it was by design (it doesnt seem like it would be terribly difficult to just push his head into his torso either).	0.0					77

10121	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	4	Next, the gun itself.	0.0					4
10122	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	5	Viewed as a refined Maverick, the Spectre address several concerns from the older gun very well.	0.0					16
10123	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	6	The rotary chambers swing out much further from the frame, allowing easier reloading (although it must be manually closed, rather than flicked closed one-handed like the Maverick can be).	0.0					28
10124	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	7	The chambers advance on cocking, rather than firing, preventing the somewhat-common effect on the Maverick where the chambers dont advance properly.	0.0					20
10125	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	8	The top-mounted tactical rail is on the frame and not the slide, so attaching an accessory does not impair use.	0.0					19
10126	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	9	The gun has the now-standard front-barrel and rear-stock mounting, whereas the Maverick has just the top-mounted rail.	0.0					13
10127	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	10	Other differences from the Maverick are not direct improvements, and negligible.	0.0					11
10128	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	11	The grip on the Spectre is shorter but not much thinner (I am 63 and it seems a little awkward but workable, my 5-year-old brother found it no more comfortable than the Maverick).	0.0					31
10129	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	12	The gun holds 5 shots, rather than 6, which either matters a lot (if you need 1 more shot) or not at all (if you dont).	0.0					23
10130	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	13	I consider the easier reloading to more than offset the 16% reduction in capacity.	0.0					13
10131	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	14	The trigger pull is gentler (since it is no longer advancing the chambers), but the difference is minor.	0.0					18
10132	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	15	Range is slightly shorter than my original-run Maverick, but also negligible.	0.0					10
10133	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	16	The gun is a little longer than the Maverick, which is somewhat expected with the addition of the front barrel-mount, but it feels like it could have been shorter.	0.0					28
10134	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	17	The more slender profile accentuates the extra length but it is, honestly, probably not a very big deal.	0.0					18

10136	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	19	On to the accessories, the real reason for purchasing the Spectre over the venerable Maverick.	0.0					15
10137	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	20	As already stated, the tactical rail is in a much better place on the Spectre, although its still a little awkward to have a bulky accessory on such a (relatively) small gun.	0.0					32
10138	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	21	The front barrel-mount is also appreciated, especially after the puzzling omission on the Raider.	0.0					13
10139	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	22	The Recon barrel extension (aka two extra tactical rails) is also rather bulky for the size of the gun but if you NEED to have a laser, a flashlight, and the kitchen sink attached then having that extra capacity is essential.	0.0					41
10140	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	23	The included barrel extension has no rails and is purely cosmetic, but the bore is wider/shorter than previous accessories, so it purportedly has less negative impact on range.	0.0					27
10141	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	24	I did not test to verify that, as it seems like a useless peripheral to me anyway.	0.0					17
10142	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	25	Lastly, there is the included folding stock included with the Spectre.	0.0					11
10143	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	26	Every other difference from a Maverick or a Recon is, in my opinion, minor.	0.0					14
10144	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	27	The folding stock is undeniably a great idea and the execution is satisfyingly solid.	0.0					14
10145	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	28	While not as firm as the Raider stock, I would say it is comparable to the Recon stock in sturdiness.	0.0					20
10146	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	29	The swivel mechanism is smooth and the lock seems to work fine.	0.0					12
10147	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	30	There is no actual locking mechanism, just a tab/slot arrangement, but theyve included an indicator to show you if it is fully engaged and it feels firm.	0.0					26
10148	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	31	If used regularly, its conceivable that it would deform and not hold as well, but only time will tell.	0.0					19
10149	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	32	Overall, I would consider the gun comparable to a Maverick or Recon but the folding stock is a great addition to any arsenal.	0.0					23
10150	10941	B0046QU5EK	AE7WZ5DBOH8WO	Toys & Games	33	At $20 Id consider it a decent deal, but if you dont expect/need a stock or tactical rails I would still recommend the $8 Maverick.	0.0					22

11463	11651	B004XPIQJ0	A292W1LK5EZJSY	Toys & Games	6	Basically, if you already have the Day at the Maul Fashion Set, dont bother with this version of Frankie unless you want the blue face-up (or theMonster High Classrooms Draculaura Dollfor that matter, her leggings lack the cute little bows that are on her outfit in the Maul set), and if youre looking for a starter doll, this doll is fine, but dont bother with the Maul Fashions Set for extra clothes unless you reallllly have your heart set on Clawdeens accessories in that set.	0.0					84
11464	11651	B004XPIQJ0	A292W1LK5EZJSY	Toys & Games	7	As for me, Ill keep the stock body for this doll as is and custom the Dead-Tired Frankie instead since this doll has blue make-up and earring holes, so its all worked out okay for me, but unless that is your express purpose, I dont see any reason to get this doll if other Frankies are available at a similar price-point because the Day at the Maul clothes are a step up from these, and youd be limiting yourself as far as clothes sets.	0.0					81
11465	11651	B004XPIQJ0	A292W1LK5EZJSY	Toys & Games	8	If you can still find them for a reasonable price-point, I would recommend getting something like the Gloom Beach dolls because the dolls still have earring holes (the Dead-Tired dolls, while pretty, do not), and then buy Day at the Maul Fashion Set to obtain the look you see on Frankie here because youll have a doll AND a slightly upgraded versions of these clothes for less than the cost of two cheap dolls.	0.0					72

12281	12213	B0060S315W	ACTS6G5MMQMY5	Toys & Games	17	Some people have said that they have an issue with the durablity, i however have not noticed this.	0.0					18
12282	12213	B0060S315W	ACTS6G5MMQMY5	Toys & Games	18	This could be more due to the fact that they are younger people playing with the dolls and not just displaying them as I would, but so far I have found the durablity to be excellent from the whole line.	0.0					40
12283	12213	B0060S315W	ACTS6G5MMQMY5	Toys & Games	19	Over all I found this doll to be a nice addition to the line.	0.0					14

12285	12213	B0060S315W	ACTS6G5MMQMY5	Toys & Games	21	Then this lil lady could be a great alternative to paying such a high price for the main verison of the doll.	0.0					22
12286	12213	B0060S315W	ACTS6G5MMQMY5	Toys & Games	22	So I would say that alone she is a great buy, and as a change or subsitution from the main doll she is an awsome choice.	0.0					26

12288	12214	B0060S318E	A3FNV09127NV3G	Toys & Games	1	I really like these and love the idea of swapping and changing around the parts to make a new monster, however, the big downer on these is the fact that you are always left with bits that cant be used.	0.0					40
12289	12214	B0060S318E	A3FNV09127NV3G	Toys & Games	2	If the company sold spare upper arms, thighs and torsos that would be a much better idea and much better value for money.	0.0					23
12290	12214	B0060S318E	A3FNV09127NV3G	Toys & Games	3	Im waiting till I can get more parts, until then these are just sitting around in their boxes.	0.0					18
12291	12214	B0060S318E	A3FNV09127NV3G	Toys & Games	5	Another suggestion would be that you could swap parts with the regular range of Monster High dolls, because the fittings are larger they are incompatible so you cant even use a broken doll to supplement your parts.	0.0					37
12292	12214	B0060S318E	A3FNV09127NV3G	Toys & Games	6	I really dont think theyve thought this through, unless it was their intention to wast plastic and have kids get bored with them very quickly?	0.0					25
12293	12215	B0060Y27O2	AE9B0N86KP1OU	Toys & Games	1	I bought this because I assumed a battery-powered water gun would be easier for my 3 year-old to use, as opposed to a pump action one.	0.0					23
12294	12215	B0060Y27O2	AE9B0N86KP1OU	Toys & Games	2	The distance definitely isnt as good as the Point Break (pump action W/ TRIGGER) that I bought at the same time.	0.0					20

12296	12215	B0060Y27O2	AE9B0N86KP1OU	Toys & Games	4	My biggest complaint is that it stopped working on the second day- I found water in the battery compartment (had been stored dry/drained overnight).	0.0					22

12298	12215	B0060Y27O2	AE9B0N86KP1OU	Toys & Games	6	I will say that Amazon was great about the return process (very quick and easy), as they always are.	0.0					19
12299	12215	B0060Y27O2	AE9B0N86KP1OU	Toys & Games	7	Another good thing is that my son can now use the pump action Point Break, so I can save the batteries for the countless other toys in our house.	0.0					29
12300	12221	B0062DMB4M	A2G82XZYUY0986	Toys & Games	1	The doll itself is really cute but the stand and position of the tail really sucked, especially because i love to display my girls.	0.0					24

12319	12230	B0063I6Y2G	AQG17YFAR1ANR	Toys & Games	7	In addition, the boards along with some special action tokens can be different each game, leading to a new game each time.	0.0					22

12321	12230	B0063I6Y2G	AQG17YFAR1ANR	Toys & Games	9	The one drawback in the game is that it is very unforgiving at the beginning.	0.0					15

12328	12230	B0063I6Y2G	AQG17YFAR1ANR	Toys & Games	16	This greatly reduces the luck factor and, in my opinion, greatly increases the enjoyment due to having more choice.	0.0					19
12329	12230	B0063I6Y2G	AQG17YFAR1ANR	Toys & Games	17	Some argue this lengthens the game, however, in my experience the length of the game is far more dependent on the playing style of those at the table.	0.0					28
12330	12230	B0063I6Y2G	AQG17YFAR1ANR	Toys & Games	18	When approached about this, the designer preferred to keep the game as it was and won the Spiel des Jahres so its obviously a quality game as written.	0.0					28

12341	12243	B0064Z54Z6	A630U5ET4DPB7	Toys & Games	10	It is true that sometimes he needs help pulling something out or pushing something in but he is younger than the recommended age so I dont think of that as a criticism just as something to note if you are buying this for a younger child.	1.0	Usage	yes	before		46

12406	12270	B006CC0HR6	A3DZFEICHK5LF2	Toys & Games	5	They will wear out, or break, and you will have to buy more tops.2) The kids can mix and match top parts to get different performance which often means buying more tops.	1.0	Usage	yes	both		31

12408	12270	B006CC0HR6	A3DZFEICHK5LF2	Toys & Games	7	Overall I think its a good introduction, but, it seems to me to be more of a newbie set, for kids who are just starting out.	0.0					26
12409	12270	B006CC0HR6	A3DZFEICHK5LF2	Toys & Games	8	Probably a good gift to get a kid who isnt into beyblades yet, or a kid who wants to start with beyblades.	0.0					22

12412	12270	B006CC0HR6	A3DZFEICHK5LF2	Toys & Games	11	For experienced collectors, its more like 3 stars because it doesnt allow your kid to experience some of the cooler aspects of playing, like, customization.	0.0					24

12421	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	1	My twin 5 year old daughters got this for their birthday from a friend and they love it, they are big My Little Pony fans and one is also a train freak, so that helped.	0.0					34
12422	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	2	The quirks are as follows.	0.0					5
12423	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	3	The back of the box shows a nice long train but it only comes with the engine and a small blue train cart to tow behind it, the other cars are sold separately.	0.0					33
12424	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	4	OK, so other cars are sold separately, but stores including Harbro no longer have them and people are price gouging here on Amazon and on eBay for them (retail was $12.99), so you cant get the extra cars (I did find, after calling around, a Sweetie Belles train car at Toys R Us and picked that up, but Fluttershys train car will have to wait till I can find it affordably).	0.0					70
12425	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	5	If Target and Walmart and Harbro are going to stock and sell the train set they really should also stock and sell the extra cars, frustrating.	0.0					26
12426	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	6	I found Raritys Gem Carriage and bought it only to find out it was not meant to go with the train (wrong wheels) despite having the same couplers, so the train freak runs the train off the tracks to include Raritys Carriage.	0.0					42
12427	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	7	The tracks dont go far and Hasbro does not make extra track, so you either have to have a limited toy or buy a second train set to get extra track.	0.0					31
12428	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	8	Like many toys, batteries were not included and the girls were very bummed that they had to wait to use the toy until we could get to the store to get batteries.	1.0	Complementary product	yes	after		32
12429	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	9	I gave it a 4 for fun because it does not hold the girls attention as long as Id like unless you make a change, like switch the track configuration or get a new car for it, or when they realized they could run it off the tracks.	0.0					47
12430	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	10	I guess the main reason I only it gave it 4 instead of 5 overall is the lack of availability of the additional cars and the limited nature of the toy because of the small amount of track.	0.0					36
12431	12272	B006CC0TQ0	AERBY54RWPSO9	Toys & Games	11	Other than these complaints, the toy is abfab for My Little Pony addicts, my girls really do love it.	0.0					19

12697	12392	B006ROJI38	A19JDXB5R33C7R	Toys & Games	4	With them, you build two hollow half-balls, each consisting of 20 pieces, and then join them together into one ball.	0.0					18

15155	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	11	What I remember the Bird of Prey looking like is more along the lines of a goose, or a swan, in flight.	0.0					22

15159	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	15	However, this past week, I was able to get to see the new movie, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Bird of Prey in the new film is clearly what this Kre-O kit is designed to look like.	0.0					40
15160	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	16	The vehicles in the new movie have moving wings and are very short on the front, just like this Kre-O kit.	0.0					20

15163	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	19	The only couple of issues that I have are it appears that from time to time the parts used in the build are slightly different from the parts that are shown in the instruction manual.	0.0					35
15164	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	20	For instance, in my instruction manual it showed that on the main wings I should have five pegs along the back of the wing nearest the inside of it, but my actual part in my kit only had four pegs.	0.0					40
15165	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	21	This didnt change how the ship was built, or functions, but it did create a tad bit of confusion as I was trying to figure out where exactly to place the pieces that were attaching to the top of the wing.	0.0					41

15171	13443	B00AWP7Q7I	A58437AUQICZF	Toys & Games	27	I have noticed that several reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere on the web have mentioned that they didnt get the correct stickers in their kits.	0.0					26
