369	986	B00005RCQS	AUBKXJYRKGOF4	Sports & Outdoors	3	The 1 5/8 thickness also makes the mat very comfortable and shock-absorbent -- I imagine itd be great for tumbling and/or doing any kind of ab workout where you sit a lot.	0.0					27
370	986	B00005RCQS	AUBKXJYRKGOF4	Sports & Outdoors	4	However, I originally bought this mat for Insanity, and I found two drawbacks with it for that program: (1) The thickness of the mat makes it a bit unstable for quick lateral movements and floor holds, which are HUGE parts of the Insanity workouts.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		43
371	986	B00005RCQS	AUBKXJYRKGOF4	Sports & Outdoors	5	(2) The smooth material gets very slick with sweat, which makes it a bit treacherous (at one point I slipped over sideways doing a 1-2-3 Heisman... but at least the thickness of the mat padded my fall!).	1.0	Warning	yes	before		35
372	986	B00005RCQS	AUBKXJYRKGOF4	Sports & Outdoors	6	I was also using this mat on top of a carpet and found that it tended to slide around, though I think itd stay in place better on wood.	0.0					29

374	986	B00005RCQS	AUBKXJYRKGOF4	Sports & Outdoors	8	(I eventually wound up getting an oversized yoga mat for Insanity because it has better traction and is a bit more stable for sideways movements and push-ups/planks.)	0.0					26

1161	1590	B0000C50SR	A1U4JWHUO6QDVP	Sports & Outdoors	20	However, the advantage of the Cordura nylon case is that it is more compact and sticks out from your belt less than this rigid case (especially if you sew it a little tighter around the speedloader), and it can be squashed flat with the speedloaders removed.	0.0					46
1162	1590	B0000C50SR	A1U4JWHUO6QDVP	Sports & Outdoors	21	So the cordura nylon case is probably preferable to wear under a coat, vest, or loose shirt for concealed carry.	0.0					20

3581	4942	B000EQ815G	A1AZIOGG5OORJB	Sports & Outdoors	11	One is that the plastic tent pole attachment piece is considerably stronger than my older tent, a big improvement as some people had trouble with this part breaking in cold weather.	0.0					31
3582	4942	B000EQ815G	A1AZIOGG5OORJB	Sports & Outdoors	12	The second change is in the shock cord material.	0.0					9
3583	4942	B000EQ815G	A1AZIOGG5OORJB	Sports & Outdoors	13	My much older tent had thinner shock cords on the fly and tent peaks, while these newer models have heavier shock cord.	0.0					22
3584	4942	B000EQ815G	A1AZIOGG5OORJB	Sports & Outdoors	14	This has not been a change for the better - I have had to replace ALL (10 per tent) of these shock cords because the rubber breaks inside the cloth material.	0.0					29
3585	4942	B000EQ815G	A1AZIOGG5OORJB	Sports & Outdoors	15	Sometimes it breaks in many places, leading me to believe that the rubber material is breaking down, not simply snapping.	0.0					20

4935	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	9	I sprayed the fly with a fabric waterproofing spray and applied a seam sealer on the fly seams (although I do not think this was at all necessary - the seams were already well taped - I do it to all tents anyway) and let the tent sit overnight.	0.0					47
4936	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	10	The next night I and my 8 year old boy slept in it.	0.0					12
4937	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	11	He brought in a large inflatable air matress and I used a Thermarest sleep pad.	0.0					15
4938	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	12	It was a little cramped for me because of his big matress, but I still had more room than I do in my bivy tent (Snugpak Stratosphere).	0.0					27
4939	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	13	Two adults with sleeping pads would fit fine in there.	1.0	Size	yes	both		10

4941	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	15	Thankfully for testing purposes we got some rain.	0.0					8
4942	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	16	Not a savage thunderstorm but not a drizzle either.	0.0					9
4943	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	17	The only rain that got in was from when I exited and entered the tent; a small amount got in then, but I didnt even notice it through the night.	0.0					30
4944	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	18	Aside from that the tent was completely waterproof, not a drop got in.	0.0					13
4945	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	19	Also, there was no condensation (it was a balmy 80 degrees throughout the Texas summer night), but even if there was I dont think it would be an issue as the fly does not at any point actually touch the mesh walls of the tent.	0.0					44
4946	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	20	When not raining we kept the fly doors open until it was time to sleep, and had very good ventilation with them open.	0.0				before	23
4947	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	21	With them closed we got some air but it was pretty warm, so I stuck a portable fan in there and we slept fine.	1.0	Usage	yes	both		24
4948	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	22	I think the best way to do it is to sleep with the fly doors open and simply close them at the first drops of rain, they close pretty easily and quickly.	1.0	Other	yes	after		32
4949	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	23	Other items of note:- The no-see-um mesh is very fine and no bugs can get through it, though there is a small gap in between the zippers that a very small bug might be able to get through.	0.0					37
4950	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	24	We had no bug issues.- The vestibules are plenty large enough to accomodate my pack, and would accomodate a larger one, too.	0.0					21
4951	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	25	I can put it in the area towards the feet of the tent and still enter and exit without having to climb over the pack.- The removable gear loft is somewhat loose and will need to be tightened by folding it up a bit and sewing it, but otherwise it works fine.	0.0					51
4952	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	26	My kid stuck his Kindle Fire up there and watched a movie through the mesh.- The eyelets are handy for seeing whats going on outside.- With a guyline deployed on the front of the fly where your feet are and two deployed on the back where your head is the fly does not touch the tent, and ventilation is greatly improved.	0.0					59
4953	5796	B000MAOEB4	A1TMH98ARQNC5B	Sports & Outdoors	27	I didnt see any reason to deploy any more than those 3, as the fly when staked out is perfectly taught, though there are some extra guylines and tie out points.- 2 Adults CAN fit in here just fine as long as A) they are not very large people and B) they dont mind rubbing elbows a bit.	0.0					55

6841	6636	B000VOEIQM	A6FIAB28IS79	Sports & Outdoors	4	The Slendertone is quite effective for this purpose, but it is also one of the stronger electromagnetic jolts that Ive experienced from such a device.	0.0					25

6847	6636	B000VOEIQM	A6FIAB28IS79	Sports & Outdoors	10	Although its tempting to reuse the pads and save a few bucks by simply  applying fresh conductive gel to the rubberized areas that meet the skin (tubes of the gel are readily available through Amazon and other dealers), the wrong formulation could prove to be under or over-conductive for the electrical current transmitted by this particular product.	0.0					56

7702	7054	B0012SDT9S	A28KVM17HZ1HVL	Sports & Outdoors	10	Pros:- Solid construction- Swings down for hatch access- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paintCons:- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pinOther Thoughts:- Loading two bikes is tight.	0.0					40
7703	7054	B0012SDT9S	A28KVM17HZ1HVL	Sports & Outdoors	11	You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but its still a squeeze.- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if its secure, its sturdy.- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4 socket will fasten this to your receiver.	0.0					109

9048	7546	B00190VMFM	A1WVYN27YIMRER	Sports & Outdoors	10	More on that lockback mechanism: on some other knives, once you disengage the lockback, you have to either push on the back of the blade or sort of shake it down a bit to get it to clear the mechanism, and then get your fingers out of the way, and then push the blade closed the rest of the way.	0.0					60
9049	7546	B00190VMFM	A1WVYN27YIMRER	Sports & Outdoors	11	With this, as with most lockback Spyderco knives, once you disengage the lockback, the blade goes LIMP, it just kinda dangles there loosely without any spring tension, and theres a nice safe flat spot at the back of the blade edge that allows you to catch it with your fingertip without cutting yourself, so you can then get your fingers out of the way and close it easily.	0.0					68

9052	7546	B00190VMFM	A1WVYN27YIMRER	Sports & Outdoors	14	One more thing: theres a nifty notch cut out of the lockback tab, so you cant accidentally disengage the lock while youre gripping the knife.	0.0					25

11915	8580	B001Q4FG3A	A1H4IVXNXWWBLV	Sports & Outdoors	16	Search the internet for instructional videos, but here is a summary of some of the major points:1) When gripping the pole, put your hand up through the strap and grip the pole such that the strap is in your palm and you are putting your downward force on the strap.	1.0	Usage	no	after		49
11916	8580	B001Q4FG3A	A1H4IVXNXWWBLV	Sports & Outdoors	17	This helps so that that you dont need to keep a firm grip when pushing down on the pole.2) The length should be such that when on a level surface, your arm should be at a 90-degree bend when gripping the pole.	0.0				after	40
11917	8580	B001Q4FG3A	A1H4IVXNXWWBLV	Sports & Outdoors	18	You can also adjust the pole longer for descents and shorter for ascents to help with pole placement.3) When on a regular stride, plant the right pole with the left foot and the left pole with the right foot, so that your step and pole planting alternate.	1.0	Usage	no	after		46
11918	8580	B001Q4FG3A	A1H4IVXNXWWBLV	Sports & Outdoors	19	This is similar to your natural arm motion when walking and the poles just become an extension of your arms.	0.0				after	20

11989	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	3	It does extremely well in broad daylight, but in low light conditions (similar to what you might find in certain indoor ranges) the red dot is often too bright for me and since its supposed to have auto-adjust capability as such its not user-adjustable.	0.0					42
11990	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	4	Perhaps I might feel differently had I went with the version of the RMR with the smaller 4 MOA red dot, but since I generally like to shoot outdoors the larger dot of the 8 MOA RMR variant was the preferred choice.	0.0					40

11993	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	7	Trijicons product literature claims that the CR2032 wafer battery will last as long as 4 years (under certain storage conditions), but for a normally cheap bugger like me running ANY battery when a device isnt being used just seems counter-intuitive to the idea of saving on resources (and perhaps affecting its overall reliability as Ill explain shortly), appears very much like unnecessary waste and makes me wonder that at some point in the future unknown if the battery will wear down or be dead completely in some scenario when I need for it to work the most.	0.0					94

12000	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	14	But in this case to do such us RMR owners have to disassemble the RMR from its mounting plate to gain access to its wafer battery in order to pop it out; thats the SOLE means available to turn off the power short of breaking the RMR.	0.0					47
12001	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	15	The one bright thing about this procedure is that the RMR mounts firmly to the plate without and detectable play or wiggle, otherwise it would certainly be a continual pain to have to re-sight the RMR each and every time I wanted to turn this device off/on.	0.0					45
12002	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	16	It also means that making sure to have along the proper hex wrench with me is an absolute must.	0.0					19
12003	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	17	To make it easier I usually reconnect the battery at the bench before taking the RMR out for a range session, and remove the battery at the bench when I come back; at least Ive come to grips with being able to live with that amount of wasted battery use.	0.0					50
12004	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	18	But in all honesty, in hindsight I likely would have gone with the cheaper Burris Fastfire II had I realized just how irritating this lack of a power switch was going to be for me and my sensibilities.	0.0					38
12005	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	19	To my ingrained way of thinking the RMRs lack of an on/off switch is a rather glaring fault (Ive certainly harped about it enough here in this review), but once this little sight in its element during firing use the RMR has been a very solid sighting device even if I dont trust just how auto-adjusting this sights red dot illumination truly is.	0.0					61
12006	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	20	Yet again back to the power control, for the serious money it takes to acquire one of these it does seem rather outlandish that Trijicon chose not to build in a power switch despite the claims of lower power drain, even if the control might lessen just how rugged this RMR would be.	0.0					53
12007	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	21	In the end I suppose I dont see the intrinsic value with the pricey device--limited lifetime warranty notwithstanding--especially when compared with similar but lower priced options.	0.0					28

12010	8616	B001QSZVZE	A3OEWQXYMIXYVI	Sports & Outdoors	24	It wasnt a biggie since I typically carry a set of hex wrenches in the tool kit within my rifle case and several sets loitering around my workbench, but I dropped an email to Trijicon expressing my disappointment for this oversight on their part, which I admit IS irritating considering the hefty pricing of Trijicons products, including this RMR.	0.0					59

13248	9415	B002N14G22	ARS39PBKE0I5	Sports & Outdoors	5	It has a thinner cozy on the cooking cup and the handle is also flimsy, it worked ok but I think the thicker cozy is better protection against getting burned.	0.0					30

13254	9415	B002N14G22	ARS39PBKE0I5	Sports & Outdoors	11	The sol has an improved regulator though and boils water slightly faster than the flash or the zip but 20-25 seconds faster is no big deal to me.	0.0					27
