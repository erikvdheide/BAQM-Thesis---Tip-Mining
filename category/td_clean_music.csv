7018	3050	B0002E4Z8M	A1QDSJZQWJZOL1	Musical Instruments	42	Its especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.	0.0					34

7022	3050	B0002E4Z8M	A1QDSJZQWJZOL1	Musical Instruments	46	This is a problem because the SM7Bs diaphragm is actually back a few inches.	0.0				after	13
7023	3050	B0002E4Z8M	A1QDSJZQWJZOL1	Musical Instruments	47	So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color.	0.0					42
7024	3050	B0002E4Z8M	A1QDSJZQWJZOL1	Musical Instruments	48	In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, youd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser.	0.0					18

7030	3050	B0002E4Z8M	A1QDSJZQWJZOL1	Musical Instruments	54	Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though its not completely transparent and honest.	0.0					25

7118	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	6	While both of these switches can be useful, I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments that need to be done.	0.0					28
7119	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	7	If you dont have outboard processing, both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises (for example, someone bumping the table) to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better.	0.0					50
7120	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	8	When I reviewed the Heil PR-40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit.	0.0					28
7121	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	9	While the PR40 is about $70.00 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR-40 users will want to use a shockmount (about $100) and pop filter / windscreen ($15 - $60) to get the best results out of the microphone.	0.0					46
7122	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	10	With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens (one for normal use and one for ultra-close up use) with the microphone.	0.0					34
7123	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	11	So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the Heil.	0.0					20
7124	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	12	Another thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR-40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank.	0.0					16
7125	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	13	It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand.	0.0					25
7126	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	14	Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off-axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications.	0.0					22
7127	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	15	The SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR-40, so youll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer / pre-amp that can handle the microphone.	0.0					28
7128	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	16	The bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it.	0.0					18
7129	3054	B0002E4Z8M	A2XXBZPQT5EXHV	Musical Instruments	17	If youre comparing it to the Heil PR-40 most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very, very close.	0.0					36

8947	3417	B0002GMGYA	A2101DHHDMZ93X	Musical Instruments	15	This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later.	0.0					21

8953	3417	B0002GMGYA	A2101DHHDMZ93X	Musical Instruments	21	Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.	0.0					25
8954	3417	B0002GMGYA	A2101DHHDMZ93X	Musical Instruments	22	If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, Id probably give it 5 stars given the price.	0.0					16

8956	3417	B0002GMGYA	A2101DHHDMZ93X	Musical Instruments	24	IDK how much R&D; its worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but thats is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off.	0.0					34

11483	4891	B000EELFTW	AKGWRO6IC0VIE	Musical Instruments	20	All this said, the bottom line is that I prefer using this OVER my German made Hohner holder because its better ergonomically (taller), holds my harp more securely, and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the nouveau single butterfly nut design of my more expensive German Hohner.	0.0					56

11500	4894	B000EENH5W	A2SBZZ1HSR7WSP	Musical Instruments	2	To use place the capo on your strings with the short end facing you, use your left thumb to hold it in place with the short end dangling just below your thumb, next loop the long end over the back of the neck using your right hand to pull it under the neck and then up toward your thumb, this will trap the short end under the long end and prevent the long ends eyelets from touching your instruments neck, now just rotate your left thumb out of the way so you can buckle the strap in place and you are all set.	1.0	Usage	yes	after		103
11501	4894	B000EENH5W	A2SBZZ1HSR7WSP	Musical Instruments	3	I prefer this capo over the other 2 I have because it is so tiny, barely  bigger than the first two joints of my pinkie, and yet it does the job it was designed for, its small size means I can toss it in my mandos hardcase storage box and forget about it till I need it.	0.0					56

11804	6100	B000OR88JE	A1YP96MT6W9FTB	Musical Instruments	2	A couple of notes, though:  (1) on the positive side, they are made in the U. S. A. of American-produced materials (unlike silk and steel strings by a famous American guitar company whose name starts with M, which are assembled south of the border); (2) on the negative side, they cost more than M-----s silk and steel strings; (3) in general, silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings, especially more than flat-wound acoustic strings; (4) the tone is very nice and mellow, sort of a cross between flat-wound steel strings and nylon strings; (5) the DAddario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot, or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion; (6) they really work best for finger picking (whatever you do, dont use metal finger picks), and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking.	1.0	Warning	yes	before		149

14790	12933	B008BPI2HE	A14JBDSWKPKTZA	Musical Instruments	44	So if youre running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo.	0.0					89

14792	12933	B008BPI2HE	A14JBDSWKPKTZA	Musical Instruments	46	Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it wont slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting.	0.0					57
14793	12933	B008BPI2HE	A14JBDSWKPKTZA	Musical Instruments	47	Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position.	0.0					17
