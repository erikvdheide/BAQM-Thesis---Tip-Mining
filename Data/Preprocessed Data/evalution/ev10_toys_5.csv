114	B000F6RWW8	ADZ0GY72RN2S5	Toys & Games	10	but i m sure he wud play it again with same enthu when i bring it back to him a month later.	26	2	22

121	B000F6RWW8	ALUV2YKWZENKK	Toys & Games	10	The simple side shows you the exact shape for each piece (white lines drawn on the picture show you how to assemble the tangram), so it's not too difficult for a young one to figure out where things go, and when you flip it over it's a classic tangram puzzle that you have to figure out yourself (unless you conveniently remember the positioning from the other side... so your child will either be learning spacial manipulation or memorization or both).	28	2	80
122	B000F6RWW8	ALUV2YKWZENKK	Toys & Games	10	The pieces are sturdy and the magnets are strong, so they stick to the board even when two or three cards are layered on top.	28	3	25
123	B000F6RWW8	ALUV2YKWZENKK	Toys & Games	10	She also loves it when she plays her game and I get out my own tangram set.	28	4	17
124	B000F6RWW8	A300HB9HYDP68X	Toys & Games	10	I bought this because I wanted to give my toddler (4yrs) something to do during her quiet time.	29	1	17

128	B000F6RWW8	A16MNAUMOFXBBM	Toys & Games	10	It is very educational, durable and no matter the age, you will also love to be creative using it.	30	2	19
129	B000F6RWW8	A16MNAUMOFXBBM	Toys & Games	10	We take Tangoes Jr. every where we go, because it is so transportable: we have taken it on road trip's, to friends houses, resturants, etc.	30	3	24
130	B000F6RWW8	A16MNAUMOFXBBM	Toys & Games	10	You will not be disappointed!	30	4	5
169	B000GKAU0O	A1M5KCVI5RXBSV	Toys & Games	10	My son is way into puzzles and we have purchased other Melissa & Doug puzzles for him.	36	1	16
170	B000GKAU0O	A1M5KCVI5RXBSV	Toys & Games	10	These are a it hard because of the fact that they are shaped like the picture rather then square.	36	2	19
171	B000GKAU0O	A1M5KCVI5RXBSV	Toys & Games	10	It probably says that in the description somewhere but my husband and I missed it completely and were very surprised when we opened up the box.	36	3	26
172	B000GKAU0O	AYKPSAYZ8NL2D	Toys & Games	10	I love the fact that there are four mini puzzles in the box.	37	1	13
173	B000GKAU0O	AYKPSAYZ8NL2D	Toys & Games	10	My 3 year old son flips the pieces over to match the shapes on the back.	37	2	15
174	B000GKAU0O	AYKPSAYZ8NL2D	Toys & Games	10	Once  he separates the pieces, he usually watches me put the puzzles together.	37	3	13
175	B000GKAU0O	AYKPSAYZ8NL2D	Toys & Games	10	The pieces and box are VERY sturdy and durable.	37	4	9

178	B000GKAU0O	AV3AUFSA1DXVZ	Toys & Games	10	I know it for a fact because whenever he opens the drawer to pick out a puzzle (out of 20), his hand always comes out with this one.	38	3	27
179	B000GKAU0O	AV3AUFSA1DXVZ	Toys & Games	10	The pieces are big, the colors are great, the drawings are clear and cute.My kiddo chewed one piece, oh, IDK why he chose the ship.	38	4	24

181	B000GKAU0O	AV3AUFSA1DXVZ	Toys & Games	10	Great gift, too!	38	6	3
182	B000GKAU0O	A2O2NBBLQS154R	Toys & Games	10	These puzzles are great quality.	39	1	5
183	B000GKAU0O	A2O2NBBLQS154R	Toys & Games	10	the problem I have with this particular puzzle is that the way some of the pieces are cut, they do not really &#34;hook&#34; into each other.	39	2	26
184	B000GKAU0O	A2O2NBBLQS154R	Toys & Games	10	The result is a puzzle piece that will kind of shift when little hands are trying to put another piece in.	39	3	21
185	B000GKAU0O	A2O2NBBLQS154R	Toys & Games	10	Not the end of the world or anything, but it can lead to a grumpy 3 year old that wants it to be perfect once he puts in the piece.	39	4	29
186	B000GKAU0O	A2TI4Y4OJEFDJF	Toys & Games	10	These are very well constructed.	40	1	5

219	B001A5SNXA	AJXB8N23GMST4	Toys & Games	8	The chalk is fine - the colors are pretty light so all come out looking almost white, but my kids dont seem to care.	46	3	23
220	B001A5SNXA	AJXB8N23GMST4	Toys & Games	8	The individual pieces of chalk are a little thick for my kids to hold well, but they will grow into them.	46	4	21
221	B001A5SNXA	A1HPGF4D3FG70A	Toys & Games	8	i gave these to kids aged 2,4, 10, and 40.they all had a ball writing all over wood deck and steps.Its been awhile since such an inexpensive gift has been such a hit.the size of the chalk works perfectly for litttle hands and the older ones didnt complainthen, a gallon jug of water on its side washed all away.	47	1	54
222	B001A5SNXA	A1HPGF4D3FG70A	Toys & Games	8	No one was upset, they just had a clean deck to decorate	47	2	12

228	B001A5SNXA	AHRF1ZD9XO5SD	Toys & Games	8	She does tend to throw it and it does break, but the pieces break into pieces that are large enough to use comfortably and it holds up amazingly well when left out in the rain.	49	2	35
229	B001A5SNXA	AHRF1ZD9XO5SD	Toys & Games	8	She is still on the first four pieces of chalk that I gave her two months later even though she has decorated the driveway on multiple occasions.	49	3	27

310	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	As I said at the beginning these are basically the same concept - letters in a fruit shaped pouch.	70	2	18
311	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	The Appletters is geared more to ages 5 and up where as the PairsinPears in geared more to ages 3 and up, which the letter sizes makes the difference here.	70	3	28
312	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	What I like about these games is that each has a small little booklet with game ideas for you.	70	4	19
313	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	They have multiple games and it's not just set one way as many other games are.	70	5	16
314	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	The letter tiles as well as the fruit pouches are high quality and definitely made to last.	70	6	17
315	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	Plus the sizing of the game will make it easy to toss in a purse or handbag to have a game to play when you're on the go or have young children you need to keep occupied at the doctors office.Needless to say I had a pleasant experience with Bananagrams and their games and looking forward to playing all the little games they have to offer with Sophia.	70	7	67
316	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	She's 5 and fixing to go into kindergarten and she enjoys sounding out her letters and making words now so this is definitely ideal for her and something the whole family can play.	70	8	32
317	B002P584A6	A2Y2BV6ZG5F6PM	Toys & Games	5	This game is definitely a recommendation I can easily make for all families!READ FULL REVIEW: http://www.closetsamples.com/review-appletters-and-pairsinpears/	70	9	17
318	B002P584A6	A3C6A40RHKRZBV	Toys & Games	5	When I first read how you play appleletters I thought it sounded great.	71	1	13
319	B002P584A6	A3C6A40RHKRZBV	Toys & Games	5	I love bananagrams so I thought I would give it a shot.	71	2	12
320	B002P584A6	A3C6A40RHKRZBV	Toys & Games	5	The only problem with the same is the score keeping is very complicated, but the strategy and planning mindset is great.	71	3	21
321	B002P584A6	A3C6A40RHKRZBV	Toys & Games	5	Also because of the way you keep score, its not good for Shabbat.	71	4	13
322	B002P584A6	A3C6A40RHKRZBV	Toys & Games	5	Overall I look forward to playing it again though.	71	5	9
323	B002P584A6	A2QT151K3BOAFA	Toys & Games	5	The challenge with this game is to form words at the beginning or end of the word chain created, which forms a worm shape.	72	1	24
324	B002P584A6	A2QT151K3BOAFA	Toys & Games	5	It's fun and children as young as 8, or those who are able to spell, can play.	72	2	16
325	B002P584A6	A2QT151K3BOAFA	Toys & Games	5	It's quick and easy, but I wish there were a tray provided to set the letter tiles to be played.	72	3	20
326	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	I got this for my mom for Christmas and when I first held it in my hands I knew she would love it.	73	1	23
327	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	The packaging alone looks so cute!	73	2	6
328	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	the tag on it said it is a combination between scrabble and dominoes.	73	3	13
329	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	You can play it anywhere.	73	4	5
330	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	My parents ride on a ferry all the time for hours at a time and thought this would be fun for them.	73	5	22
331	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	my mom can throw it in her purse and go!	73	6	10
332	B002P584A6	AY3SB8LDBWK20	Toys & Games	5	I want one for me!	73	7	5
333	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	These are super fun.	74	1	4
334	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	The appletters is my husband and I's favorite one to play over and over and over.	74	2	16
335	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Of course he kicks my butt, I am just not good at these sort of games, but I keep playing for the fun of it.	74	3	25
336	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	I love how you can store the pieces inside with or without the bag which is nice.	74	4	17
337	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Loosing pieces is not fun at all.	74	5	7
338	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	The game is simple and easy and all you do is build off the first or last letter and draw, discard and first one out wins.	74	6	26
339	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	The pairs one, is a little more need of concentrating keeping score and what not.	74	8	15
340	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Or play the simple games with your kids, it is geared more towards toddlers and kids, pieces are bigger, they have designs on them, something fun for them.	74	9	28
341	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	My son just likes matching the designs and bold ones together he's 3 and doesn't quite understand the idea, but he will soon!	74	10	22
342	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Both are great games.	74	11	4
343	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Material is soft and you can store the letters in the bags, love how they look like what the game is called.	74	12	22
344	B002P584A6	A9LLBMFJ0G0TH	Toys & Games	5	Great game, 2+ players, easy, and totally fun to play with others, great for party's!	74	13	14
345	B003BNZNNW	A3KC0CRGLO5LXJ	Toys & Games	5	My 7yo daughter and 8yo son love this game.	75	1	7
346	B003BNZNNW	A3KC0CRGLO5LXJ	Toys & Games	5	It's even easy to play solo.	75	2	6
347	B003BNZNNW	A3KC0CRGLO5LXJ	Toys & Games	5	I am not a huge fan of the slapping noise the game makes when you catch a ball but I live with it because the kids enjoy the game :)	75	3	29
348	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	Silly name - but a great toy.	76	1	6
349	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	This is one of the more popular outdoor toys in our house.	76	2	12
350	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	The kids love it.	76	3	4
351	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	My only complaint (and its a minor one)...is that the balls are quite small.	76	4	15
352	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	(a little smaller than a ping-pong ball?).	76	5	6
353	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	So in tall grass, its easy to lose the balls.	76	6	10
354	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	It's no fun searching for the balls when its time to clean-up and go back inside.	76	7	15
355	B003BNZNNW	A3O1EFKA6UXFHR	Toys & Games	5	Otherwise -- great fun!	76	8	3
356	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	I was stuck inside with my seven-year-old niece recently while we waited patiently for everyone to hurry their selves up and get ready to go, and this game proved a fun distraction, even inside a tiny apartment.I found it easy to learn to throw and challenging to learn to catch, but my niece picked it up super-quickly, maybe because I was feeding her some easy practice shots, and we had a blast throwing and giggling and catching.The balls are tiny enough that they roll under stuff easily.	77	1	83
357	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	By the end of the first 15 minutes we'd lost one ball permanently.	77	2	12
358	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	But the benefit to the balls being so tiny is that they're lightweight enough not to do any damage.	77	3	19
359	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	I smacked the TV with a stray shot as well as a few decorative items and nothing looked even close to getting damaged.	77	4	23
360	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	Not to say it's impossible, but you'd be more likely to dive into something making that far-off catch than you would be to hurt something with the ball.We took it outside to play as well, and it was even more fun with more room.The one thing I don't care for is the noise.	77	5	50
361	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	I can imagine if someone were trying to nap, this would keep them from doing so.	77	6	16
362	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	Every time you catch it goes CLACK!!	77	7	7
363	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	I mean, that's probably better than someone going Mommmmeeeeee!	77	8	9
364	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	every five seconds, but it could still use a little toning down of the annoyance factor if used primarily for indoors.	77	9	21
365	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	Why not design a version with foam on to reduce the racket?Anyway, this was a fun toy that got me and my niece up and being active when everyone else was sitting on their behinds being boring.	77	10	38
366	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	It felt like it was good for making friends, because even though my niece barely knows me (we live a long way apart), we were giggling and having fun in just a few minutes.	77	11	34
367	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	I'd definitely recommend this.	77	12	4
368	B003BNZNNW	A2MBLVMVDLHK1L	Toys & Games	5	It's fun, it's collaborative, it's active - what more can you want from such a small toy?	77	13	16
369	B003BNZNNW	A2RM1Y6IP6BBCB	Toys & Games	5	We gifted our daughter this for her 10th birthday and she LOVES it.	78	1	12
370	B003BNZNNW	A2RM1Y6IP6BBCB	Toys & Games	5	It's super easy to use and tons of fun!	78	2	9
371	B003BNZNNW	A2RM1Y6IP6BBCB	Toys & Games	5	The balls are similar to ping pong balls and therefore won't be great for playing on a windy day but we haven't run into any problems with it yet.	78	3	29
372	B003BNZNNW	A2RM1Y6IP6BBCB	Toys & Games	5	Great gift!	78	4	2
373	B003BNZNNW	A1OKNIKI54VQ1K	Toys & Games	5	I bought this for a birthday party my daughter was invited too - her friend was turning 7.	79	1	16
374	B003BNZNNW	A1OKNIKI54VQ1K	Toys & Games	5	His mom requested outdoor gifts and apparently this was a hit - he spent the entire evening with his friends playing it.	79	2	21
375	B003BNZNNW	A1OKNIKI54VQ1K	Toys & Games	5	I bought one for my daughter as well thinking it would also help with strengthening hand muscles and we've really enjoyed it.	79	3	22
376	B003BNZNNW	A1OKNIKI54VQ1K	Toys & Games	5	Durability wise - we've not had any problems yet but the fabric part (orange) doesn't appear that durable so we'll see how long it lasts.	79	4	24
377	B003BNZNNW	A1OKNIKI54VQ1K	Toys & Games	5	Until then we're enjoying it and it gets the kids out of the house.	79	5	14
378	B004JA7M4E	A21VMME3RYDJZ5	Toys & Games	5	This is an awesome set of crayons!	80	1	7
379	B004JA7M4E	A21VMME3RYDJZ5	Toys & Games	5	They are made of beeswax so they smell pleasant (and I am not too freaked out if my son sticks one in his mouth for a second) and the colors are gorgeous on paper.	80	2	34
380	B004JA7M4E	A21VMME3RYDJZ5	Toys & Games	5	My 18-month old seems to be enjoying coloring more ever since I got these.	80	3	13
381	B004JA7M4E	A21VMME3RYDJZ5	Toys & Games	5	I actually like them better than the set of Stockmar crayons I had purchased previously (which are much more expensive).	80	4	20
382	B004JA7M4E	A21VMME3RYDJZ5	Toys & Games	5	Worth the price, especially if you have a slightly older toddler who enjoys art.	80	5	14
383	B004JA7M4E	A28WQBBSTXC0VH	Toys & Games	5	My children really enjoy coloring with these.	81	1	7
384	B004JA7M4E	A28WQBBSTXC0VH	Toys & Games	5	They find satisfaction in using them as the colors are vibrant and true, and make beautiful pictures	81	2	17
385	B004JA7M4E	AZVT0WAEWQNZJ	Toys & Games	5	I like these crayons because they are not made from petroleum-based products.	82	1	11
386	B004JA7M4E	AZVT0WAEWQNZJ	Toys & Games	5	The colors are vibrant, and there is a good range.	82	2	10
387	B004JA7M4E	AZVT0WAEWQNZJ	Toys & Games	5	I also like the shape - they don't roll away as easily, and they are easier for little fingers to hold.	82	3	20
388	B004JA7M4E	A2KRPMQU7P3TX7	Toys & Games	5	These crayons produce such vibrant color with little effort.	83	1	9
389	B004JA7M4E	A2KRPMQU7P3TX7	Toys & Games	5	They don't seem to break as easily perhaps because they make such a great sweep of color for the three year old!	83	2	22
390	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	99% of the time, my kids color with Crayolas.	84	1	8
391	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	We buy a bunch of boxes at the beginning of the school year when they're usually 25 cents or so---and leave it at that.	84	2	23
392	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	But, I've always wanted to try beeswax crayons.	84	3	8
393	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	Perhaps I've been on too many Waldorf forums... but every time I see them, I kind of salivate...yet I can't justify the price.	84	4	24
394	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	I saw some on sale on a different site, so was searching on Amazon to compare prices and came across these Faber-Castell crayons.	84	5	22
395	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	They're still a lot more expensive than Crayolas--but a better deal than most beeswax crayons.	84	6	16
396	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	These are really thick crayons...think 3-4 Crayolas thick...with great colors.	84	7	11
397	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	A few different shades of tan/brown... a bunch of gorgeous blues and greens.	84	8	12
398	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	Really lovely.	84	9	2
399	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	They're super sturdy, so great for smaller kids who tend to put a lot of pressure on crayons and break them.	84	10	21
400	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	I'm glad I splurged.	84	11	4
401	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	"We'll still buy the Crayolas for school, but the ""special"" crayons will be broken out for special art projects, etc.We've had these about a week now--and my kids have zero desire to go back to Crayolas."	84	12	36
402	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	They notice a difference when coloring.	84	13	6
403	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	"My daughter(4) says, ""The colors are so nice and it's fun to color with them."""	84	14	15
404	B004JA7M4E	A17SZZO9LM3WYC	Toys & Games	5	I tried a bit of coloring with them too, and I have to agree.	84	15	14
405	B005KSZO0I	AHH6C8YE9WLOY	Toys & Games	5	I love this series of toys I have a collection you my son, I bought the Sky Shadow reaglo birthday and asked me to give away the Autobot Junkheap, once I get the detail and is very well done, I have not taken of the box as it is a Christmas gift, I am very eager to see the face that will put.recommended	85	1	62
406	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	Transformers Generations Junkheap autobotI bought this for my 9 year old grandson who is extremely adept at putting things together, figuring out how to get through a brain buster puzzle, building intricate structures from his imagination, putting together model buildings such as the empire state building as an example, and using his Snap Circuit sets designed for 9 year olds and up to make short wave radios, clocks,and other intricate circuit type items.	86	1	72
407	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	He has never had a problem with any of the above mentioned toys.	86	2	13
408	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	This transformer is meant for a child of 5 and up and is a Level 2 which indicates that the difficulty transforming this from a vehicle into a robot and back again is somewhat challenging but not impossible.	86	3	36
409	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	He tried looking at the pictorial directions which are very confusing and numerous.	86	4	13
410	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	After trying for a while he decided that it wasn't worth the effort.	86	5	13
411	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	There are no written directions only unclear thumb nail pics which are very difficult to understand.	86	6	16
412	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	He owns several other transformers which are Level 2 and Level 3 and loves playing with them and converting them back to either the robot or vehicle phase.	86	7	26
413	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	The age of 5 years and up which is the age group this was designed for as indicated on the package is very misleading.	86	8	23
414	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	Unless you are willing to sit with a child and follow the pictorial unclear directions patiently while instructing the child how to proceed, forget about purchasing this particular transformer.	86	9	29
415	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	This one is being returned.	86	10	5
416	B005KSZO0I	A2C5V5VRE1FK3W	Toys & Games	5	Hopefully they will come up with better written and pictorial directions so that it will be easier to figure out just how to transform this transformer.	86	11	26
417	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	"This is the third version of this toy released, the first was the Classics ""Wreck-Gar"" after the Transformers animated movie from the 80's, second was ""Scrap Heap"", available as a Japanese exclusive."	87	1	30
418	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	Motorcycle Transformers usually aren't that good but Junkheap and his brothers actually do it right.	87	2	15
419	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	The transformation isn't to difficult and his weapons are part of the bike in vehicle mode.	87	3	16
420	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	The best part is if you have any two of these one can actually ride the other!	87	4	17
421	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	The only real downside to these is they aren't in scale with the other figures.	87	5	15
422	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	either you make the cycles tiny to where the robot modes aren't in scale or you make the robot mode in scale and then you have giant bikes.	87	6	28
423	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	It's just inherent in trying to make motorcycles in any of the TF lines.	87	7	14
424	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	The other problem is as soon as you place a weapon in either hand they immediately show stress marks on the hand.	87	8	22
425	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	Hasbro has said it poses no threat to breaking the toy but it's still unnerving as a collector to see stress marks on a brand new toy.	87	9	27
426	B005KSZO0I	A2HRYSRE2MMTAS	Toys & Games	5	All in all Junkheap is anything but!	87	10	7
427	B005KSZO0I	A6LHCT7P53RSA	Toys & Games	5	This was a gift for my son for Christmas.	88	1	9
428	B005KSZO0I	A6LHCT7P53RSA	Toys & Games	5	He loves it!	88	2	3
429	B005KSZO0I	A6LHCT7P53RSA	Toys & Games	5	Its one of his favorite transformers!	88	3	6
430	B005KSZO0I	A6LHCT7P53RSA	Toys & Games	5	I would recommend this transformer to anyone who has a transformer lover in their life!	88	4	15
431	B005KSZO0I	A1SPYR77O0W4V5	Toys & Games	5	I like that he transforms into a motorcycle.	89	1	8
432	B005KSZO0I	A1SPYR77O0W4V5	Toys & Games	5	rolls quite well.	89	2	3
433	B005KSZO0I	A1SPYR77O0W4V5	Toys & Games	5	fun to play with.	89	3	4
434	B005KSZO0I	A1SPYR77O0W4V5	Toys & Games	5	a little hard .	89	4	3
435	B005KSZO0I	A1SPYR77O0W4V5	Toys & Games	5	to transform into motorcycle would recommend him.	89	5	7
