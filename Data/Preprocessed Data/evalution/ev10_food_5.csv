367	B000FYYOXU	A2ESLC1U16C00S	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I gotta force myself to only eat one a day.	104	2	11
368	B000FYYOXU	A2ESLC1U16C00S	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	The price is okay probably not the healthiest thing to eat.	104	3	11
369	B000FYYOXU	A2FO745AH4IAVY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I purchase these often.	105	1	4
370	B000FYYOXU	A2FO745AH4IAVY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	A nice *tang* of the Jalapeno.	105	2	6
371	B000FYYOXU	A2FO745AH4IAVY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	The folks a Buffalo Bills should be arrested and thrown in jail for making these things --they're downright ADDICTIVE and I can assure you that after you've eaten what you've purchased it will not be long before you will need ANOTHER fix.	105	3	42

374	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I'm sure plenty of folks would love this product but it's not for me.	106	1	14
375	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	It's a little bland and a little too sugary for me.	106	2	11
376	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	When I say a little, I do mean a little.	106	3	10
377	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	It's not extremely bland or really sugary but I like a stronger stick with more spice.	106	4	16
378	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Maybe they assumed I was a sissy for ordering the turkey sticks.	106	5	12
379	B000FYYOXU	ARSSOKY64C7QE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I was hoping for a healthier version of the stuff I like.	106	6	12
380	B000FYYOXU	A11ED8O95W2103	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I could hardly tell these from the conventional fat loaded pepper sticks that I never eat because I like my heart the way it is, thank you.These were great.	107	1	28
381	B000FYYOXU	A11ED8O95W2103	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I couldn't eat just one, and I had an excuse to eat several at a time because they're made with turkey!	107	2	21
382	B000FYYOXU	A11ED8O95W2103	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	It would be fun to serve some of these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.	107	3	14
396	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	We love these garbanzo beans (or chick peas).	111	1	8
397	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	They are never mushy, always firm.	111	2	6
398	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	We add them to stir-fry and chili.	111	3	6
399	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	They are also good in salads.	111	4	6
400	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	The cans do not have BPA, which is very important to me.	111	5	12
401	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	As far as I know, Eden Organic is the only company that does not use BPA in their bean cans.	111	6	20
402	B000GZU7QQ	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	Highly recommend!	111	7	2
403	B000GZU7QQ	A3173BUN91R8RF	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	I love these.	112	1	3
404	B000GZU7QQ	A3173BUN91R8RF	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	They taste great, are organic  and come in BPA free lined cans.	112	2	12
405	B000GZU7QQ	A3173BUN91R8RF	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	I love the price as well which is lower than the store cost.	112	3	13
406	B000GZU7QQ	A3173BUN91R8RF	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	Amazon subscribe and save rocks!	112	4	5
407	B000GZU7QQ	A1FDV3WPOHREY9	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	I drive over an hour through open deserted desert and across state lines to get a few cans of this, and glad to do it, in an old truck liable to shut down way out in the middle of the vultures and rattlers where nobody goes but the Border Patrol.Now I find I can get right here through the joy and convenience of the amazon!A can of this drained with a box ofMori-Nu Tofu, Silken Style, Extra Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)and some chopped celery and fresh squeezed lime and chopped onion and cilantro and maybe crushed garlic and maybe fresh jalapeno without the seeds and maybe fresh tomato from the garden and maybe you start to get something to sit down with.Or just right out of the can (drained)maybe with chopped celery and cilantroand maybe .	113	1	135
408	B000GZU7QQ	A1FDV3WPOHREY9	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	.the great hting here is they use the highest quality chick peas (garbanzo beans) and like, no salt, or very low salt.I never could figure out how to soak the dry beans to get them this good.	113	3	35
409	B000GZU7QQ	A1FDV3WPOHREY9	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	So until I figure out how to grow my own, this is as good as it gets!And thanks to amazon I won't have to risk my old truck across that desert to town anymore.One can of this and you have a meal for a day, or two!	113	4	47
410	B000GZU7QQ	A26IO3KFQWN9N3	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	Currently on the market Eden Organic is the only brand of canned beans that do not use a BPA lining or other toxic chemicals to preserve the quality of the beans, That's a plus in my book.	114	1	37
411	B000GZU7QQ	A26IO3KFQWN9N3	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	Buying these in bulk help offset the cost of these cans, in comparison to non organic beans.	114	2	17
412	B000GZU7QQ	A26IO3KFQWN9N3	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	I use Garbanzo beans a lot in salads, and if I am going to spend the money for a good quality canned product, it would be these.	114	3	27
413	B000GZU7QQ	A3CN9CCJUNIPKT	Grocery & Gourmet Food	20	We like this brand of garbanzo bean a lot... good plain, or cooked with just about anything.	115	1	17
481	B00121BQJU	A3VM63NWLYXSPV	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	BEST PACKAGED KUKICHA TEA I'VE TRIED SO FAR.	131	1	8
482	B00121BQJU	A3VM63NWLYXSPV	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Loose kukicha teas you can buy in health stores will still beat this one in taste and freshness, but out of any other pre-packaged teas I've tried this one scores the best.	131	2	31
483	B00121BQJU	A3VM63NWLYXSPV	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I recommend everyone to try it out and decide if it works for you.	131	3	14
484	B00121BQJU	A1BUXI30VSG51W	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I love this tea.	132	1	4
485	B00121BQJU	A1BUXI30VSG51W	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	The taste is very strong and fragrant.	132	2	7
486	B00121BQJU	A1BUXI30VSG51W	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I have had other teas that are comparable to this one but it isn't the same.	132	3	16
487	B00121BQJU	A2XBFVW4EE13AH	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	This is a good Kukicha Tea.	133	1	6
488	B00121BQJU	A2XBFVW4EE13AH	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I prefer some other brands but this one has nothing objectionable about the quality of the tea.	133	2	17
489	B00121BQJU	A2XBFVW4EE13AH	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I don't really like the cellophane packaging and the bags are not always stapled shut securely so I often wind up with floating twigs in the tea.	133	3	27
490	B00121BQJU	A2XBFVW4EE13AH	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	But the tea itself is fine.	133	4	6
491	B00121BQJU	A393F381MA82AY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	One of my favorite twig teas.	134	1	6
492	B00121BQJU	A393F381MA82AY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Not as bitter as some others and supposedly alkalinizing.	134	2	9
493	B00121BQJU	A393F381MA82AY	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Better priced on amazon than in stores.	134	3	7
494	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I like this product, and used it for many years.	135	2	10
495	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	However, they reduced the package size from 20 bags to 16.	135	3	9
496	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	At that point, I switched brands.	135	4	6
497	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Unfortunately, for my last purchase, I got confused and ordered this one again.	135	5	13
498	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	However, I don't want to reward the manufacturer for taking 20% of the teabags out of the box.	135	6	17
499	B00121BQJU	A31JZQSUQOXU4U	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I won't be ordering this one again.	135	7	7
500	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Very yummy!	136	1	2
501	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	The individual packets are better than trying to shake the honey down to the spout of a squeeze bottle, and they won't get dried up like a bottle does after its too old.	136	2	33
502	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Also bottles that we used to have in the cupboard always seemed to get sticky.	136	3	15
503	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Not so with individual packets...	136	4	5
504	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I particularly like to use one packet in a cup of tea.	136	5	12
505	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	The only drawback to the packets is tearing them open and sliding/squeezing the honey out of the packet.	136	6	17
506	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I wish honey came in something more like a large toothpaste tube with a snap cap.	136	7	16
507	B001652KD8	A1QPJRSBQQF1L1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	In any case this is good honey as far as I'm concerned, and glad that I bought it.	136	8	18
508	B001652KD8	A3VD6KREW99X02	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Kinda tasted like socks.	137	1	4
509	B001652KD8	A3VD6KREW99X02	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Not sure what to make of it...funky wet dog overtones I have to pass on this.	137	2	17
510	B001652KD8	A2BICL1L5GB4PD	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	I would have given 5 stars for a better tasting honey, but this quantity and convenience is hard to be beat.	138	1	20
511	B001652KD8	A2BICL1L5GB4PD	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	If my blood sugar is dropping this is the most palatable and affordable treatment.	138	2	14
512	B001652KD8	A2BICL1L5GB4PD	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Plus these are very easy to carry.	138	3	7
513	B001652KD8	ALSFMZOJ1EQGP	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Much easier to keep and store than the cute little bear container...	139	1	12
514	B001652KD8	ALSFMZOJ1EQGP	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	The honey doesn't granulate before you can use it, and each packet is just the right size to sweeten a mug of hot tea.	139	2	24
515	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Even though it is expensive, I have found I end up spending less on it because you limit your intake.	140	1	20
516	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Each pack is 9 gram/.31 oz.	140	2	4
517	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	This works out to about 25-30 calories per pack.	140	3	8
518	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Honey pretty much lasts for ever.	140	4	6
519	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Great thing to put in an emergency kit.	140	5	8
520	B001652KD8	A3E7WMJ8PFJU99	Grocery & Gourmet Food	8	Honey can also be used on small wounds and as a basic cough suppressant (look it up on WebMD).	140	6	19

532	B001EO76U8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	The texture of this anchovy paste stays super buttery and smooth even after refrigeration and easily squeezes out of the tube (the opening in the tube is larger than other tubes too which helps in the ease of use).	144	1	39
533	B001EO76U8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	When squeezing this into a hot pot of soup, this instantly melted with a little stirring!	144	2	16
534	B001EO76U8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	The taste is excellent.The shipping and packaging was also top notch.Great product all the way around!P.S.	144	3	14
535	B001EO76U8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	The expiration dates give you around a year but no worries.	144	4	11
536	B001EO76U8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	If you keep these in cold storage as soon as you get them, they will last far longer than that (refrigeration helps keep the oils from going rancid).	144	5	28
537	B001EO76U8	A1XD710QD1HCI1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I've tried several brands of anchovy paste over the years, and this is a very good one.	145	1	17
538	B001EO76U8	A1XD710QD1HCI1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I mostly use it for flavoring my pasta sauce , which it does quite well.	145	2	14
539	B001EO76U8	A1XD710QD1HCI1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	"People rave about my sauce, and ask me what my secret is, and usually act shocked when I tell them that anchovy is a big part of the unique flavor....since 90% of the people out there ""hate"" anchovies , or at least they think they do."	145	3	45
540	B001EO76U8	A3SWPS1O7DU6RE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Considering how fast my roommates and I can go through pasta sauce, making a meat sauce can be expensive.	146	1	19
541	B001EO76U8	A3SWPS1O7DU6RE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Adding a tube of anchovy paste to a large pot of my basil sauce makes a meaty flavor that's makes the sauce on par with bolognese.	146	2	26
542	B001EO76U8	A3SWPS1O7DU6RE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Everyone loves my sauce and it's probably because of this paste.	146	3	11
543	B001EO76U8	A3SWPS1O7DU6RE	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I don't tell anyone though, if they knew it was fishy they probably wouldn't eat it.	146	4	16
544	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	This product by Amore is one of the three different flavors I often use in my cooking: The other two flavors are sun-dried tomato paste and pesto paste.	147	1	27
545	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	In very small amounts only because it is salty I use the anchovy paste in my caesar salad dressing, or on pasta, and on crostinis--Italian or French bread sliced about 1-1/2 inches thick--or on small, round, homemade pizzas which I make from store-bought pizza dough.For the crostinis and pizza, I first brown each side in my cast iron skillet.	147	2	58
546	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	After they've cooled a bit, I rub raw garlic on each side and then I drizzle some extra virgin olive oil on each side.	147	3	24
547	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	When the oil has seeped down into the lightly browned slices of bread or pizza, I squeeze a VERY THIN ribbon of anchovy paste along with some tomato sauce atop each slice.	147	4	32
548	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Meanwhile my oven is heating to 375 degrees F, while I apply other toppings, such as shredded cheeses and smoked paprika and herbs or whatever suits my fancy, atop each slice of crostini or small round of pizza.	147	5	37
549	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Then I place them onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and slip it into the oven for five to seven minutes.	147	6	20
550	B001EO76U8	A1DJ9FOEOA0WF1	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Along with a fresh, tossed salad this makes a tasty meal and certainly satisfies the taste buds of everyone in my family.	147	7	22
551	B001EO76U8	AXO4PQU0XG3TG	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	I use this ingredient whenever I make pasta and sometimes in soups.	148	1	12
552	B001EO76U8	AXO4PQU0XG3TG	Grocery & Gourmet Food	5	Of the tomato, pesto and anchovy tubes I have purchased, this has turned out to be the best purchase.	148	2	19

555	B001PB2ZP6	AY0WPNYO66YAA	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	"I heard about Medjool Dates watching a ""Deliciously Ella"" video on Youtube and she used and recommended these dates."	150	1	19

558	B001PB2ZP6	AY0WPNYO66YAA	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	I snack on them and put one (pit removed) in a Smoothie or a Kale juice to add some sweetness.	150	4	20
559	B001PB2ZP6	AY0WPNYO66YAA	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	Highly recommend.	150	5	2

563	B001PB2ZP6	AYQQOW0VR0YF5	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	I've found it hard to leave them alone, so tried to hide them from myself.	152	3	15

566	B001PB2ZP6	AYQQOW0VR0YF5	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	I bought them for a recipe, but now I can't remember where I found it.	152	6	15
567	B001PB2ZP6	AYQQOW0VR0YF5	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	By the time I do find it, they'll all be gone and I'll have to buy more!	152	7	17
568	B001PB2ZP6	AYQQOW0VR0YF5	Grocery & Gourmet Food	10	Just the thought is so depressing, to relieve my agonizing, I'll have to eat another one...Don't forget they have seeds, but it's easy to remove them.	152	8	27
