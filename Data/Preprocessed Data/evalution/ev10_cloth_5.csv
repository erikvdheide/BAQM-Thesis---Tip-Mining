2	B000J3H31W	A1P64ZMQZDLL1W	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	The points of the shoes kind of start to go up, as in elf shoes but nothing tremendously obvious.	1	3	19

4	B000J3H31W	A36NGMIQTDR5YT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	Usually I get a 7 to be on the safe side.	2	2	10
5	B000J3H31W	A36NGMIQTDR5YT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	However, the 7 is way too big - so you may want to go down a size.	2	3	15
6	B000J3H31W	A36NGMIQTDR5YT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	This shoe is also really shiny.	2	4	6
7	B000J3H31W	A36NGMIQTDR5YT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	If they fit they would be a pretty comfy shoe and look nice with dress pants.	2	5	16
8	B000J3H31W	A3G3JYRMZN9XR9	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I bought these in the fushia plaid (which is more of a purple) & I always get compliments when I wear them.	3	1	21
9	B000J3H31W	A3G3JYRMZN9XR9	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	They are comfortable but they have no arch support (not a problem for me) & they are not high quality but for the money you can't expect them to be.	3	2	29
10	B000J3H31W	A3G3JYRMZN9XR9	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	They were definitely a good buy.	3	3	6
11	B000J3H31W	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I purchased these on a whim when I saw them come up as a Lightning Deal.	4	1	16
12	B000J3H31W	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	The reviews were good and I was in need of a new pair of black flats.	4	2	16
13	B000J3H31W	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	The only problem I found with the reviews that I read were that they seemed all over the board about what size to order; some said they run small, some said too big and others said just right.	4	3	38

17	B000J3H31W	AUJW5O2PQUDAF	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I first bought these in black leather and wore them so much that I had to have another pair.	5	1	19
18	B000J3H31W	AUJW5O2PQUDAF	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	The nude patten is a little dressier than the plain leather black so they are great to dress up a pair of jeans or wear with dresses.	5	2	27
19	B000J3H31W	AUJW5O2PQUDAF	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	They are super comfortable and I am already considering adding another pair yo my collection.	5	3	15
52	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	Yes it fit but I think it's kind of a stretch to call it &#34;one size&#34;.	13	1	16
53	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	I think on a smaller girl, it would have looked better and that was disappointed.	13	2	15
54	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	Especially because I am not very big.	13	3	7
55	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	I normally wear a size 10-12 so I feel like one size should at least fit that.	13	4	16
56	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	For the price it was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this.	13	5	11
57	B000UPVCPW	A18LVHY887HL23	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	It just looks awkward.	13	6	4

64	B000UPVCPW	A17YPB3JICRUK2	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	This thing is sexy!	15	2	4
65	B000UPVCPW	A17YPB3JICRUK2	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	It also was a great price.	15	3	6
66	B000UPVCPW	A17YPB3JICRUK2	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	She is  like 5'2 and 130 or so and it fits her REAL well.	15	4	12
67	B000UPVCPW	A17YPB3JICRUK2	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	It says it is one size and I don't know if it will fit ALL WOMEN.Seems to be well made.	15	5	19

69	B000UPVCPW	A3U01S8J00YSRE	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	The material is a little cheap, but overall it has a nice look and is sexy enough for the bedroom!	16	1	20
70	B000UPVCPW	ACYANSO2REKG6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	This product is very sensual and fits very well in the body of a woman.	17	1	15

72	B000UPVCPW	ACYANSO2REKG6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	39	I recommend it.	17	3	3
207	B000W8YCHW	A3SX5OYZ80U6YD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I love the fact that these are both black and white.	52	1	11
208	B000W8YCHW	A3SX5OYZ80U6YD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	They remind me of men's wingtips.	52	2	6
209	B000W8YCHW	A3SX5OYZ80U6YD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Being both colors they can be worn all year round.	52	3	10
210	B000W8YCHW	A3SX5OYZ80U6YD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Also, I am only 5 feet 3 inches tall and the heel is just enough to get my jeans off the floor.	52	4	20
211	B000W8YCHW	A3SX5OYZ80U6YD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I would recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for shoes that have both black and white on them.	52	5	20
212	B000W8YCHW	A2C7UF7AZVF4UC	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I get tons of complements when ever I wear these out.	53	1	11
213	B000W8YCHW	A2C7UF7AZVF4UC	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I also have the plain black ones I wear almost daily, great comfort and but dressy enough to wear at the office.	53	2	22
214	B000W8YCHW	A1UW5FGCABJ8QB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	On the screen I loved the look of these, and since the price was low enough (for leather!)	54	1	18
215	B000W8YCHW	A1UW5FGCABJ8QB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	to be almost free, I ordered them.	54	2	7
216	B000W8YCHW	A1UW5FGCABJ8QB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Unfortunately, the leather was stiff and cut painfully into the top of my foot.	54	3	14
217	B000W8YCHW	A1UW5FGCABJ8QB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Also, when I actually saw the shoes, my thought was that the visual design would be improved if either (1) the black strap went all the way across and connected to the sole on both sides in a continuous wide black strip, or (2) the strap were white.	54	4	46
218	B000W8YCHW	A1UW5FGCABJ8QB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Back they went.	54	5	3
219	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	OK, these shoes are cool, but unfortunately sizing is irregular by comparison with pretty much any other shoes I've worn (and I've worn many).	55	1	24
220	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	My regular size 6 is way too short in the toebox, toes getting cramped and hurt, and size 7 (the do not make half sizes) is HUGE.	55	2	25
221	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	So I have to deal with size 6 and occasional blisters.	55	3	10
222	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	They seem to be fairly sturdy, but for street wear and not dog walking, as I learned the hard way.	55	4	20
223	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	They match pretty much anything from long skirts to pants and look awesome with my knee high and thigh high socks.	55	5	21
224	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I clean them with a damp rag and rub some beeswax shoe protector on them, they are still shiny after a year's use.	55	6	23
225	B000W8YCHW	A2QKJ5F5ZK3UKD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I suggest putting Band-Aids on your heels while breaking them in, they tore up my feet pretty bad in the beginning.	55	7	20
226	B000W8YCHW	A378E10AXX8RVH	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I absolutely love T.U.K.	56	1	3
227	B000W8YCHW	A378E10AXX8RVH	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	This is my 6th pair and I plan to keep buying them as long as they continue to make such comfortable and cute shoes.	56	3	23
228	B000W8YCHW	A378E10AXX8RVH	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Love these!!	56	4	2
229	B000W8YCHW	A378E10AXX8RVH	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	They break in easily (usually within the first day) and are extremely comfortable.	56	5	13
230	B000W8YCHW	A378E10AXX8RVH	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I'm so glad amazon carries this brand because I have yet to find it in a store in my area.	56	6	20
236	B002BA5NS6	A9FJFURSISMVT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	These are pretty nice earrings for the price.	58	1	8
237	B002BA5NS6	A9FJFURSISMVT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	Not too heavy, not too light.	58	2	6
238	B002BA5NS6	A9FJFURSISMVT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	They are exactly as described.	58	3	5
239	B002BA5NS6	A9FJFURSISMVT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I like them.	58	4	3
240	B002BA5NS6	A2AAZU0A1EELE8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I needed something more than just my diamond studs and my silver hoop earrings to wear to work.	59	1	18
241	B002BA5NS6	A2AAZU0A1EELE8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	These provide just the right amount of elegance without being too gaudy or flashy, and I don't need to worry about checking to make sure one didn't fall out during the day.	59	2	32
242	B002BA5NS6	A2AAZU0A1EELE8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	If I lose one, I'll just buy another pair!	59	3	9
243	B002BA5NS6	A2AAZU0A1EELE8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I doubt I will ever lose one though - the clasp is very snug and secure.	59	4	15
244	B002BA5NS6	A1DVZLY50X52IP	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I thought  they would be bigger the picture is a little mis leading but it's still a cute  pair of earrings	60	1	21
245	B002BA5NS6	A3S1JAK0NNAE00	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	These were exactly what I was looking for- very cute, doesn't have that CHEAP look, but came for a cheap price!	61	1	20
246	B002BA5NS6	A3S1JAK0NNAE00	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	quick delivery, didn't turn my ears green, A+ from me!	61	2	9
247	B002BA5NS6	AX84AFC7JX1I5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I really like the lever back design and find that these earrings are comfortable enough to sleep in.	62	1	18
248	B002BA5NS6	AX84AFC7JX1I5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	They are not so big as to appear &#34;fake&#34;.	62	2	9
249	B002BA5NS6	AX84AFC7JX1I5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	PLEASE Amazon, make these available in a cushion cut.	62	3	9
250	B002BA5NS6	AX84AFC7JX1I5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	12	I'd be happy to buy more.	62	4	6
276	B00366DZZM	ATV7SOQJ9YQ88	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I've been looking for a good-sized reasonably priced gym bag to accommodate all my yoga gear (mat, towels, change of clothes) and this seemed to fit the bill.	70	1	27
277	B00366DZZM	ATV7SOQJ9YQ88	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	This bag is much larger than I expected and could easily be used as luggage for an extra long weekend.	70	2	20
278	B00366DZZM	ATV7SOQJ9YQ88	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	There is only one zipper for each compartment, not the double sided option you might be used to and that I prefer; also  the zipper on the main compartment can be a little fussy when rounding the corner  Color is not true to picture, but that's minor considering what you get for the price!	70	3	54
279	B00366DZZM	A3O8KIPKR1I1IB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	durable and easy on the eyes.	71	1	6
280	B00366DZZM	A3O8KIPKR1I1IB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	the photo shows it muuuch lighter than the actual color which is more of the purple on the wrapper for crayola's violet purple crayon.	71	2	24
281	B00366DZZM	A3O8KIPKR1I1IB	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	...that has to be the most specific description I've ever made for a color...	71	3	14
282	B00366DZZM	A2BJSUKXYWI3K2	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	This bag is great for travel or just about anything else.You can put everything you need for a trip and go.Love it.	72	1	20
283	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	We purchased 3 of these.	73	1	4
284	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	First 1 to make sure they would meet our needs and than 2 more.	73	2	12
285	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	The first one arrived in 2 days as promised.	73	3	8
286	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	The second 2 I ordered late one afternoon and they were sitting on my porch at 11am the next day!	73	4	18
287	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Great job Amazon.com!	73	5	2
288	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Pretty soon you will be shipping things to me before I order them!We are shortly headed for Africa and will be traveling on small aircraft with strict luggage requirements.	73	6	30
289	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	"Only small duffle type bags are allowed so they can be ""stuffed"" into small spaces on the aircraft."	73	7	18
290	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Since all of our luggage is softsided with stiff frames and wheeled, neither of which is allowed, I needed to find acceptable bags to use.	73	8	25
291	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	I also did not want to spend a lot since this would likely be the only time we will be using them.	73	9	22
292	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Oh, and I needed to be able to lock the bags, if possible.These bags fit the bill perfectly.	73	10	17
293	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	They are suprisingly large and 3 should easily hold our 10 days worth of clothing and other stuff.	73	11	16
294	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	The quality for the price is excellent and should hold up when tossed around by the airport gorilla baggage handlers and stuffed into the tiny luggage space in the tail of our aircraft.	73	12	33
295	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	(I actually think these will hold up better than our expensive travel luggage does.	73	13	14
296	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	)As for locking, the large top opening has a double sided zipper so it can be zipped from each side and the tangs locked.	73	14	24
297	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	The side pouches however only have a single sided zipper with one tang and so can not be locked.As I mentioned, our original plans were to find somthing cheap since we would only be using them for this one trip to Africa.	73	15	41
298	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	"For that reason we picked the ""Purple"" color since they were $19, compared to $26 for the other colors."	73	16	17
299	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Plus, what better color to aid in finding your luggage at the airport than purple!	73	17	15
300	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	However, now that we see the size and quality of them, I suspect they will be seeing many more trips after Africa.To summarize, the price of these bags is excellent, the quality is excellent, they are suprizingly large and the color is just what you need to easily find your bags at the airport.	73	18	53
301	B00366DZZM	A2KWZ0EUPU8SPD	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	The only down side, for us, you can not lock the side pockets.	73	19	13
302	B00366DZZM	A2OXWWWCJJPB32	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	Just the right size and shape of the bag.	74	1	9
303	B00366DZZM	A2OXWWWCJJPB32	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	6	It also doesn't have any exterior markings (which I did NOT want) so all in all I am happy.	74	2	19
306	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	Based on earlier reviews I ordered a large.	76	1	8
307	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	"I am 5'4"" on a good day and average build."	76	2	9
308	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	When I put this on the crotch was hanging to my kness (no joke!)	76	3	14
309	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	and the legs were about a foot too long.	76	4	9
310	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	I plan on washing this in hot water and trying to shrink it.	76	5	13
311	B003VPOBCO	A1VRQBAKU6PC4U	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	I'm okay with the legs being too long because I can fold my feet into the extra fabric to keep them warm but holy cow...	76	6	25
312	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	I have to say this is probably my favorite purchase of the year.	77	1	13
313	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	I've never owened a union suit but I don't think I'll ever go through another winter without one.	77	2	18
314	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	Wearing it underneath clothes, I hardly know I have it on!	77	3	11
315	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	It keeps me warm when I'm outside and keeps my heating bills down when I'm inside.	77	4	16
316	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	It's like a second layer of skin...and there's a butt-flap for when I need to poo so I don't even have to take it off.	77	5	25
317	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	Get one.	77	6	2
318	B003VPOBCO	A2GO7QGEGIYY4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	You won't regret it.	77	7	4
319	B003VPOBCO	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	This Hanes Camo Thermal Union Suit was a little scratchy and somewhat loose when it first arrived but improved after the first washing and became just about perfect after the third washing.	78	1	32
320	B003VPOBCO	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	The material is good quality and I love the camo pattern.	78	2	11
321	B003VPOBCO	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	"This has buttons going up the front and a ""hole"" with overlapping fabric (to prevent ""drafts"") in the rear.I hate being cold, which is unfortunate because we live on mountain in PA, and I have pretty much decided to live in this Union Suit for the remainder of the winter."	78	3	49
322	B003VPOBCO	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	My wife says it is the least attractive thing she has ever seen me wear, but it keeps me very warm and that really is my biggest concern!Recommended!CFH	78	4	30
323	B003VPOBCO	A1QASWWV3HB49	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	I will be returning this product as it is not as thick as i hoped for and am concerned about the warmth.	79	1	22
324	B003VPOBCO	A38ZNBAICRTLFC	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	Even Florida was cold this winter and these long-johns felt great under a robe.	80	1	13
325	B003VPOBCO	A38ZNBAICRTLFC	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	FIt (Tom is 6' and 200lbs) was as expected although the &#34;drop-seat&#34; in back really only works for number &#34;one&#34;.	80	2	17
326	B003VPOBCO	A38ZNBAICRTLFC	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	19	Easy to wear, easy to launder.	80	3	6
417	B004NNVGNA	A3FQVK3MC1C4VI	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Very cute but go a whole size up - run very small.	95	1	11
418	B004NNVGNA	A3FQVK3MC1C4VI	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	They also are shaped for narrow (flat) feet toward the toes.	95	2	11
419	B004NNVGNA	A3FQVK3MC1C4VI	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The front of the boot is wide across and flat and press a bit in the front portion if my feet.	95	3	21
420	B004NNVGNA	A3FQVK3MC1C4VI	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The lining on my first pair were bunched in the right boot so I had to return but I ordered a new pair.	95	4	23
421	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Arrived in a timely manner.	96	1	5
422	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	They are nice and warm.	96	2	5
423	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	There should probably be another lace hole toward the top though.	96	3	11
424	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	When you pull the laces tight the top part of the boot doesn't get pulled in very tight.	96	4	18
425	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	That's not a problem if your pants are inside the boot, but it is if your pant leg is on the outside.	96	5	22
426	B004NNVGNA	A11WHRS0C94AK6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The sole could be a bit thicker.	96	6	7
427	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Maybe I should give this boot a 4, because it could be vastly improved by simply adding your own thick insole.	97	1	20
428	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	There is simply not enough on the bottom of this boot to have enough insulation from walking on a frozen ground.	97	2	21
429	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The bottom of a boot is the most important part to me.This boot is cute, I love the feel of the inside and out.	97	3	23
430	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	There is ample insulation on the colored top half.	97	4	9
431	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	And you can even slip your foot in and wear it without having to lace it up!	97	5	17
432	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	!The rubber bottom keeps out any dampness from melting snow or slush.	97	6	12
433	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Within the rubber portion, the top inside is extremely padded and almost luxurious feeling.	97	7	14
434	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	There is plenty of give to wear thick socks IF YOU BUY A FULL SIZE UP.The HUGE problem with the DESIGN of this boot is that the sole is only slightly thicker than the rubber side walls!!!!	97	8	36
435	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Do not be tricked by the texture on the bottom, it is NOT thick at all.	97	9	16
436	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I can press my thumb on the inside and clearly feel the outline of it from the outside.	97	10	18
437	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Also, there is not enough texture to have any gripping power.I can only imagine what stepping on rocks would feel like.	97	11	20
438	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I am sending these back.	97	12	5
439	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	To bad, since I love everything except the sole of this boot.	97	13	12
440	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I would keep it if I were buying based on Looks alone.	97	14	12
441	B004NNVGNA	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	But hey, it's a boot and I want to keep my feet warm and not feel every little pebble I step on!	97	15	22
442	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I love the fit and the features of these boots.	98	1	10
443	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The lower part will keep my feet from getting wet and the upper part is adjustable.	98	2	16
444	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I only gave four stars because my feet swell, up and down and there is a seam on the upper foot that is pressing down, but it is not too bad.	98	3	31
445	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	In fact, it is like the best sewing I have seen in a boot.	98	4	14
446	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Even a half a size bigger would have made the toes move around too much, so I think that this fit was best for me (I got half size bigger than I normally wear).	98	5	34
447	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	If you go with whole size bigger, you would have to wear the thicker socks and I do not like to do that.	98	6	23
448	B004NNVGNA	AFT1VNGNMPWPZ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I am looking forward to the snowstorms, now!	98	7	8
449	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The colour is beautiful.	99	1	4
450	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	And the price is so good!	99	2	6
451	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The top of the shoes and the shaft is warm!	99	3	10
452	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	The rubber is soft, and like all Kamik shoes, will probably lasts a long time.	99	4	15
453	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	However, I had to return these, as the soles were really thin, the description said 1/2 inch, but it felt a lot thinner than that when I stood in them.	99	5	29
454	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	Thin soles are pretty useless in Canadian winters, where it's supposed to provide a buffer between the bottoms of your feet and the ground.	99	6	24
455	B004NNVGNA	A3J7EPFAQ801WQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	5	I suppose an insulated insole could have worked, but there wasn't enough room at the tops of the feet for both insoles and socks.	99	7	24
456	B005CPQRD2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I bought this to wear in the hospital when I gave birth because hospitals are notorious for being cold.	100	1	19
457	B005CPQRD2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I love it, it's very warm and comfortable while being cute.	100	2	11
458	B005CPQRD2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	"It's the perfect length for me too being that I'm 5'8""."	100	3	10
459	B005CPQRD2	AJ2FDNZ3COBFN	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	It's perfect.	100	4	2
460	B005CPQRD2	A3INPLAFCMRI3I	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I received this robe for Christmas in the red plaid color and loved it so much I bought another, in grey plaid!	101	1	22
461	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Now that summer is just about over, I had been looking for a new winter robe.	102	1	16
462	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I wanted something at least knee length, must be warm, very soft, with pockets and not overpriced.	102	2	17
463	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	So when I saw this recently on a lightning deal, it looked like it was just right.	102	3	17
464	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I chose the Vanilla Print and so far I'm very happy.	102	4	11
465	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	It's nice and warm, has pockets, falls to about the middle of my shin, and extremely soft!	102	5	17
466	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	In fact if your like me you'll find yourself making excuses not to take it of because of just how comfy it is.	102	6	23
467	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I've also had to wash it once so far and it held up beautifully.	102	7	14
468	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Because I purchased it on a lightning deal and also used a 20% discount Amazon was offering for signing up for emails, I paid less than $15.	102	8	25
469	B005CPQRD2	A353U0L2HAMSHV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Now having used the robe for several weeks, I would happily pay around $35.	102	9	13
470	B005CPQRD2	A2VS44BTWZ9Q5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	got this as a Christmas gift to my mother.	103	1	9
471	B005CPQRD2	A2VS44BTWZ9Q5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	the robe is very soft, very warm, and every comfortable.	103	2	10
472	B005CPQRD2	A2VS44BTWZ9Q5	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	She loves it!	103	3	3
473	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I really like this robe.	104	1	5
474	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	It is very comfortable and warm.	104	2	6
475	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Of course, we live in a warm climate, so it does not get a ton of use, but this is the coziest and softest robe I have ever had.	104	3	29
476	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	My only complaint would be that it seems to really like lint.	104	4	12
477	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	The entire front of the robe has picked up on lint from other items it is washed with, and perhaps from the robe itself, and it is all over the white collar of the robe.	104	5	35
478	B005CPQRD2	AWAXS66YMHMNW	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Not enough to have me remove a star, but enough for me to note that this should probably be washed by itself.	104	6	22
486	B00B4KHI5A	A35383F78OFV4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	This is my second pair of these shoes (in a different style).	107	1	12
487	B00B4KHI5A	A35383F78OFV4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	They are super cute, comfortable, and inexpensive.	107	2	7
488	B00B4KHI5A	A35383F78OFV4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I love that they come in a variety of colors and designs.	107	3	12
489	B00B4KHI5A	A35383F78OFV4B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I will continue to buy more of these in the future!	107	4	11
490	B00B4KHI5A	A25GP0VPH1ZGHR	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	These are very stiff at first and take awhile to break in.	108	1	12
491	B00B4KHI5A	A25GP0VPH1ZGHR	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	The colors are very bright and beautiful.	108	2	7
492	B00B4KHI5A	A25GP0VPH1ZGHR	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Not as comfortable as I thought they were going to be.	108	3	11
493	B00B4KHI5A	A2NUZ6SKOWRGM6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	The sneakers are very nice looking with the neon green and complimenting orange inside.	109	1	14
494	B00B4KHI5A	A2NUZ6SKOWRGM6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	They could be better if they came in half sizes.	109	2	10
495	B00B4KHI5A	A2NUZ6SKOWRGM6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Since they are laceless, the front is made tight so your feet don't slip out.	109	3	15
496	B00B4KHI5A	A2NUZ6SKOWRGM6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I wobbled for the first few days before the sneakers soften on the front toe area to be walkable.	109	4	19
497	B00B4KHI5A	A2NUZ6SKOWRGM6	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I would order them one size larger next time with innersoles to fit better.	109	5	14
498	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I love the combination of it's pink and black.	110	1	9
499	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Though, when you wear it, it's not noticeable anymore.	110	2	9
500	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I wish they just put a pink outline somewhere OUTSIDE.	110	3	10
501	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	But overall I love it and I love lace-less shoes.	110	4	9
502	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	It wears perfectly, it snug enough when you walk, it holds your feet.	110	5	13
503	B00B4KHI5A	A26OJ2TNEF11CV	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	Just not for running I guess..	110	6	6
504	B00B4KHI5A	A3F8H2JUD6S97B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I love this style of shoe.	111	1	6
505	B00B4KHI5A	A3F8H2JUD6S97B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I find that the ed hardy brand fits my foot better than converse and they're more true to sizing.	111	2	19
506	B00B4KHI5A	A3F8H2JUD6S97B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I love this vibrant yellow.	111	3	5
507	B00B4KHI5A	A3F8H2JUD6S97B	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	7	I will be ordering more in different colors.	111	4	8
513	B00E9IULVC	A1W94N4LOXQ6JU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	I ordered this with another ring from this company, ships quickly.	114	1	11
514	B00E9IULVC	A1W94N4LOXQ6JU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	I like the ring and as I said in a different review, if I had paid more than six total dollars for this ring, I would probably give it one star.	114	2	31
515	B00E9IULVC	A1W94N4LOXQ6JU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	It's thin and bends easily but works well for a midi ring (above your first kunckle).	114	3	16
516	B00E9IULVC	A23HBFRF36FEDT	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	just but this ring it is so nice..give as a gife to some one you love they will love it	115	1	21
517	B00E9IULVC	A1K8W3CFQKVXSY	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	It's very nice,but not as shinny as other silver,fit good and I'm happy w/my purchace:-) I recommend this is a good deal:-)	116	1	23
518	B00E9IULVC	AT6EWJ1BMNMFU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	I want to tell you about this product.	117	1	8
519	B00E9IULVC	AT6EWJ1BMNMFU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	Its solid sterling silver 925 made with the finest sterling silver.	117	2	10
520	B00E9IULVC	AT6EWJ1BMNMFU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	Solid and allergic free.	117	3	4
521	B00E9IULVC	AT6EWJ1BMNMFU	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	we have all the sizes between 3 to 12 at no extra cost	117	4	11
522	B00E9IULVC	A2DY019OUSSKRQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	I expected a heavier silver than what I received.	118	1	9
523	B00E9IULVC	A2DY019OUSSKRQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	But it was cheap enough so I can't complain.	118	2	9
524	B00E9IULVC	A2DY019OUSSKRQ	Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry	9	Read reviews before buying.	118	3	4
