98	B0040PDK0I	A509LPZNKHAJU	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I'm very happy with this product.	22	3	6
99	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I purchased this because I've tried others that were a pain to put on, and I figured with 3 in a pack I'd get at least one right...	23	1	27
100	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I was correct.	23	2	3
101	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	These aren't super high quality or anything, they're kinda flimsy allowing for bubbles, folds, and it will stick to itself pretty badly if allowed to bend far enough.	23	3	28
102	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	First one I put on had such a bad bubble when I put it on, that when I tried to push it out, and get it to the edge, the thin-ness of the protector actually allowed it to create a fold in itself, and i had to remove my first try.	23	4	50
103	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	Second one I got right for the most part.	23	5	9
104	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	It has a couple really small bubbles near the edges, and since i have a case on the phone you can't see them.	23	6	23
105	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I have 1 extra left for when this one gets bad.	23	7	10
106	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	We'll see how long it takes.	23	8	6
107	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	About a month and a half with the current protector, and no damage at all to the phone or the protector.	23	9	21
108	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	It's standing up pretty well.	23	10	5
109	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I'd recommend this product for the price, and the quality.	23	11	10
110	B0040PDK0I	A9J03MF2689TS	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	Ease of use I give a D- grade though.	23	12	8
111	B0040PDK0I	A3M6L13YZ8IUYJ	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	Great price!	24	1	2
112	B0040PDK0I	A3M6L13YZ8IUYJ	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	beter than any other so called high quality screen protector.	24	2	10
113	B0040PDK0I	A3M6L13YZ8IUYJ	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	Comes with three of them so they last a long time.	24	3	11
114	B0040PDK0I	AKYCL3RK6E2NI	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	GIVE TROUBLE TO PUT ON .	25	1	5
115	B0040PDK0I	AKYCL3RK6E2NI	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	HARD TO GET RID OF THE AIR BUBBLES.	25	2	8
116	B0040PDK0I	AKYCL3RK6E2NI	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.	25	3	6
117	B0040PDK0I	A1VD4NW9WTLVGH	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	It doesn't look like I have the screen protector on the phone.	26	1	12
118	B0040PDK0I	A1VD4NW9WTLVGH	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	Sticks very well, NO problems with it bubbling or coming off.	26	2	11
119	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I love this camera.	27	1	4

123	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	It was very easy to put together.	27	5	7
124	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I suggest getting a paper towel and laying out the screws the way they were in the phone.	27	6	18
125	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I put the camera in and tried it out and it worked perfectly.	27	7	13
126	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I compared it to my Uncles iPhone 4 camera and I couldn't tell which was which.	27	8	15
127	B00574S96G	ALAJWHEZ3QZOB	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I totally recommend this camera.	27	9	5
128	B00574S96G	A3PDNN5MJF9ZJ0	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	i bought a used iphone cause im cheap like that for 120 bucks for an iphone 4 and i replaced the camera and bam, bada bing bada boom...it works perfectly.	28	1	29

135	B00574S96G	A2AOBXQDUI3M18	Cell Phones & Accessories	5	I dont have a camera in my iPhone but I never use the camera anyways so its fine.	31	3	18
136	B005XHVWGQ	A3QX0ERX4D03TF	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	Inexpensive and seems to be well-made.	32	1	5
137	B005XHVWGQ	A3QX0ERX4D03TF	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	I wouldn't put a camera on this, but for small keys, flashlights or thumb drives, this is perfect.	32	2	18

142	B005XHVWGQ	AVUTTF6MN41Z3	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	I bought these as I find it a great way to secure things I want to keep safe when I use them.	35	1	22
143	B005XHVWGQ	AVUTTF6MN41Z3	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	Did have one of them fail on me while on a bus tour being used with a pocket camera.	35	2	19
144	B005XHVWGQ	AVUTTF6MN41Z3	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	The strap came out of the metal strap and my camera fell to the floor.	35	3	15
145	B005XHVWGQ	AVUTTF6MN41Z3	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	I may be partially to blame as I was using it way low in my jacket pocket and the camera may have been too heavy plus got a lot of pulling in and out.	35	4	34
146	B005XHVWGQ	AVUTTF6MN41Z3	Cell Phones & Accessories	9	The camera was fine and the one on my cell has yet to fail since it is lighter and is kept in my shirt pocket.	35	5	25

162	B006WIED5M	A39CFRGV9SKXHH	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	This product is of high quality and 100% clear given that you keep it clean and dust free during the installation.	41	1	20
163	B006WIED5M	A39CFRGV9SKXHH	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Be careful aligning it, it must be perfect or one of the corners will not fit, so you have to take it off and put it back again, for worst case scenario, you have the second one!Once you finish installing this thing is invisible!	41	2	45
164	B006WIED5M	A39CFRGV9SKXHH	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Highly recommended!	41	3	2
165	B006WIED5M	A27O4TU3J9V1V9	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	This protector does not have the orange-peel feel and is relatively easy to install specially if you manage to get your screen completely clean.	42	1	23
166	B006WIED5M	A27O4TU3J9V1V9	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	The thing I like best is that it does not make your screen dull or distort the text in any way.	42	2	21

187	B006WIED5M	ALT4TFZTMNY0J	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	I have two lumia 900s in my household and I used both screen protectors without having any difficulty.	45	15	17
188	B006WIED5M	ALT4TFZTMNY0J	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	If these are the first ones you are going to install, there is a big possibility that you will end up with bubbles or dust etc.	45	16	26
200	B0087Y3BLG	AK2R8BR8AY1IE	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	This cradle supports my iPhone at a perfect angle on my desk.	48	1	12
201	B0087Y3BLG	AK2R8BR8AY1IE	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	And since it has a slot for a standard charging cable, I do not have to worry about the charging port breaking ...	48	2	22
202	B0087Y3BLG	AK2R8BR8AY1IE	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	The only tweaking needed is the inside edges are a little sharp.	48	4	12
203	B0087Y3BLG	AK2R8BR8AY1IE	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	So I filed the slot where the cable slides and now it is perfect.	48	5	14
204	B0087Y3BLG	A2EFBO5QVM0KYW	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	when i ordered this i thought it was going to be made of plastic and was afraid it would be too thin to stand but wanted to try it anyway....it's a heavy metal and I love it!	49	1	38
205	B0087Y3BLG	A3LTDC8G0FH4B9	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Nice addition to my office.	50	1	5
206	B0087Y3BLG	A3LTDC8G0FH4B9	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Works perfect for my iPad and my iPhone which is always lying around on my desk.	50	2	16
207	B0087Y3BLG	A37NP1T8KCEMOW	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Night stand & entertainment center, any situation that a stand is needed, this one works well.	51	1	15
208	B0087Y3BLG	A37NP1T8KCEMOW	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Although, be careful of the cable you are using, it may not fit.	51	2	13
209	B0087Y3BLG	A37NP1T8KCEMOW	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	An idea would be to buy a cable extension.	51	3	9
210	B0087Y3BLG	A36YQTJ0WWZW0A	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Ordered two of these, heavy duty aluminum construction.	52	1	8
211	B0087Y3BLG	A36YQTJ0WWZW0A	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Had to bend them slightly so the charging plugdidn't hit the bottom and lift the phone.	52	2	16
212	B0087Y3BLG	A36YQTJ0WWZW0A	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Samsung SIII phones.Also use with my 7 and 8 inch Tablet's for video calls or keyboard.Not sure why some reviews say they have to thread the cable through the bottom and unplug the phone to answer it.There is an open slot down the back of the stand, to the opening in the bottom.	52	3	48
213	B0087Y3BLG	A36YQTJ0WWZW0A	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	Just lay the charging cable in the slot and the phone sits on the stand.	52	4	15
214	B0087Y3BLG	A36YQTJ0WWZW0A	Cell Phones & Accessories	7	To answer just pick up the phone and the cable comes out of the slot with the phone.	52	5	18
218	B0092QSQ3Q	ABL2CBNEXEWU7	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	These will definitely keep scratches off your phone.	55	1	8
219	B0092QSQ3Q	ABL2CBNEXEWU7	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	However, they are quite thick and you can definitely feel it as you try to swipe the screen.	55	2	18
220	B0092QSQ3Q	ABL2CBNEXEWU7	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I haven't tried many screen protectors so I'm not sure if that is normal but I cannot live with that feeling as I use my phone.	55	3	27
221	B0092QSQ3Q	A1G5VR6YBZT1DG	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	i put this on before i went to bed, made sure it was aligned perfectly and most of the air bubbles were pushed out.Putting it on was pretty easy, really nice quality.Let it sit without a case or anything for 24 hours, yet when i put my otterbox on after it had pushed up one side of the screen cover so i had to take it back off and kind of smooth it out.	56	1	71
222	B0092QSQ3Q	A1G5VR6YBZT1DG	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	Went back into place but had to leave it off another day so far haven't had any problems so maybe it just needed some extra time to sit.	56	2	28
223	B0092QSQ3Q	A2P68VRKQMYBDE	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	These screens are as good as Zaggs, and cover a little more of my phone than ZAGG.	57	1	17
224	B0092QSQ3Q	A2P68VRKQMYBDE	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I love that there is a Home button cover as well.	57	2	11
225	B0092QSQ3Q	A2P68VRKQMYBDE	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	Home buttons can get scratched easy too, and now it is covered.	57	3	12
226	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I purchased this screen protector for my iPhone 5 through Verizon, and it seems to be crooked.	58	1	16
227	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I have bought a Skinomi protector in the past for my Motorola Droid Bionic, and it lasted a very long time.	58	2	21
228	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I am hoping this one straightens out and the screen clears over the next week or so.	58	3	17
229	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	Currently the protector looks very dirty.	58	4	6
230	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	The video on youtube for installation was helpful.	58	5	8
231	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	I will probably buy another one.	58	6	6
232	B0092QSQ3Q	ATKDOMF9O74EV	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	The service was great, as always.	58	7	6
233	B0092QSQ3Q	A179FCFOKQGJFN	Cell Phones & Accessories	112	Though this product is easy to install but quality is average.I didn't enjoy my new iphone after installing this.I replaced it with other screen protector.	59	1	23
844	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	So I wasn't able to review this completely so I may have to revise this later but so far I am very happy with this.	167	2	25
845	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I took this on a cruise instead of my travel wall charger and it was a 4 day cruise.	167	3	18
846	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I had 7 people with me and we all were able to charge our phones and still be able to use it with battery life at the end of the cruise.	167	4	30
847	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This is a super powerful one.	167	5	6
848	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	There is one real down size to this which is that you are only able to charge one thing a a time.	167	6	22
849	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	There is only one outlet so that's the only real bad thing and I wasn't able to charge my samsung laptop because the adapters did not fit so I'll have to find one that fits.	167	7	35
850	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I left a message to the seller and I'm assuming from our conversation that he is sending one.Other than that it's a great charger.	167	8	23
851	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It's heavy but well worth it for a long term traveler.	167	9	11
852	B00HJKRQAQ	A1U11IP6K6NHAK	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I received this item for review.	167	10	6
853	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I'm revising my review: So after using this for a while we have one major issue with it.	168	1	18
854	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It cannot charge multiple items at once easily.	168	2	9
855	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This has turned out to be something we desire and we thought with this large a form factor that it would work.	168	3	22
856	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	USB Hub does not work well to make this happen either.	168	4	11
857	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It's still o.k.	168	5	2
858	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	and it does it's job - but this is probably best if you are somewhere you need to charge a main item multiple times than multiple items at once.Original review: This is HUGE for a battery pack but this much power requires it.	168	6	41
859	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	"Keep in mind this is not a ""drop in my purse"" charger but rather a full external battery."	168	7	18
860	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	"It is most awesomely helpful when I go camping or when I have a room full of teens who are supposed to be letting parents know they will be late due to working on homework and (invariably) they are all out of ""battery"" and I need an easy way to get their Iphone's charged."	168	8	54
861	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	For that it works great.	168	9	5
862	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It handles all sorts of electronics so as long as you've got a cord it will do it.	168	10	18
863	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	You can charge many different items with this before it gets low on juice.	168	11	14
864	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	Everything we've used on it has charged well and fairly fast.	168	12	11
865	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It's really nice when you are somewhere you know you might not have charging capacity - particularly when you have several items you know will need charging.	168	13	26
866	B00HJKRQAQ	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This thing is your Plan B and C and D completely!	168	14	11
867	B00HJKRQAQ	A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I was expecting this to be the monster of all battery packs I have as it boasts a massive 30000 mAh and the largest I have tested to date was a 12000 mAh portable charger.	169	1	33
868	B00HJKRQAQ	A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This did not last as long as I would expect.	169	2	10
869	B00HJKRQAQ	A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It was barely twice the charges that my 12000 mAh one gives me.On the bright side, despite being a lot larger in size, it actually weighs less than my 12000 mAh battery pack.It was a bit irritating that I have to select what output I want between the choices, hold down it has 12v/5v usb, press again, you get 16v and once more for 19v.	169	3	58
870	B00HJKRQAQ	A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It doesn't automatically output what is needed.The good part is that it comes with adapters to fit most laptops and I was able to use it on a dell laptop and two HP laptops.So the bad, that it doesnt last as long as a 30000mAh battery should and that you have to manually select the output you want.	169	4	55
871	B00HJKRQAQ	A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	The good is that its light and has adapters for a lot of laptops.	169	5	14
872	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I travel a lot for work and pleasure.	170	1	8
873	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This battery charger is a life saver.	170	2	7
874	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	If you travel much you know that ANY added weight in your laptop bag or purse feels like a lot more than the total sum.	170	3	25
875	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This adds about 1.5 lbs to the shoulder, which sounds like nothing, but it isn't nothing.	170	4	15
876	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	However, as much as I like to travel light, this added weight is a small price to pay for the additional life of my devices.I recently took a 10 hour travel day, with a short layover in the middle of it, and this charger saved the day.	170	5	45
877	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I didn't have time to recharge any of my devices in the airport, but was able to simultaneously charge my phone and laptop with this backup.	170	6	26
878	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I also charged my iPad on the first leg of the flight and got a full charge out of this for all of them.	170	7	24
879	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It was showing about 50-75% of life left when I got to my destination.	170	8	13
880	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It didn't get hot or give me any problems whatsoever.I am not an electrician, but I have this little voltmeter that measures the power usage while charging my devices.	170	9	28
881	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I have compared this device to the charger that came with each device plugged into the wall.	170	10	17
882	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I get virtually the identical reading charging from this as I do with my devices connected to a wall plug.	170	11	20
883	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I have other power banks and many of them don't give such consistent readings.	170	12	14
884	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	As I said, I'm not an electrician so I'm not sure how important that is for the devices, but I do know that his charger charges up my devices very quickly.This is a reliable long-life power bank.	170	13	35
885	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I will post a short video of the voltmeter readings and accessories that come with this device.Sample product provided for testing.	170	14	20
886	B00HJKRQAQ	A34BZM6S9L7QI4	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I was not required to write a review.	170	15	8
887	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This battery pack is awesome.	171	1	5
888	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	It comes professionally wrapped and has a very sleek design.	171	2	10
889	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	You get a lot of adapters to charge different devices, you also get a cool pouch to put the battery in to prevent scratches.	171	3	24
890	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I charged my iPhone 5 with this battery and the results are below.	171	4	12
891	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	This battery weighs 1 pound and 5.3 ounces, its not terribly heavy but I wish it was lighter.	171	5	16
892	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	When I started, the battery had four led lights on (that means the device is fully charged), and when it finished charging my iPhone, it still had four led lights on.My iPhone was completely dead to start:8:44am started8:53am turned on with 5%9:04am 15%9:08am 20%9:18am 31%9:26am 40%9:38am 53%9:44am 60%9:53am 70%10:04am 80%10:21am 90%11:25am 100%2 hr 41 min to completely charge my iPhone.All in all this battery pack did an excellent job charging my phone.	171	6	56
893	B00HJKRQAQ	A2KOTM09QLSYML	Cell Phones & Accessories	22	I would definitely recommend this to someone.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.	171	7	15
1132	B00HPMB38Y	APU89APVV81F8	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	This case is just wonderful I've got a lot of compliments on it.	189	1	13
1133	B00HPMB38Y	APU89APVV81F8	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	Its not really tight enough for my phone but it does keep it snug.	189	2	14
1134	B00HPMB38Y	APU89APVV81F8	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	Besides the long shipping dates for products from Hong Kong and China they actually have all the good products.	189	3	19
1135	B00HPMB38Y	A3FM6T9G4LZMGU	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	i wish the case was able to fit a little tighter but other then that everyone loves it..thanks so much	190	1	21
1136	B00HPMB38Y	A3F8T82GUC5T6B	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	I love my phone case because it is different from the rest need to order more real soon.	191	1	18
1137	B00HPMB38Y	A3F8T82GUC5T6B	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	I love it!	191	2	3
1138	B00HPMB38Y	A3423P9GKEGVWS	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	I would recommend this product to friends and family ...	192	1	9
1139	B00HPMB38Y	A3423P9GKEGVWS	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	Fits perfect for her phone and she loves it!!!	192	2	9
1140	B00HPMB38Y	A3423P9GKEGVWS	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	A great birthday gift	192	3	4
1141	B00HPMB38Y	A1G8KU9BLBMQIK	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	The ears was damaged when I received it but other than that it fits really nice and snugged.	193	1	18
1142	B00HPMB38Y	A1G8KU9BLBMQIK	Cell Phones & Accessories	14	If I didn't love Minnie i wouldn't have kept it.	193	2	10
