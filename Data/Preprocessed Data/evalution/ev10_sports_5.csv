140	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	Just got this in the mail yesterday.	30	1	7
141	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	Replaced the stock barrel and shroud on my Alpha Black, and it definitely gives the marker a more authentic look.	30	2	20
142	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	Makes the gun heavier too.	30	3	5
143	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	I haven't had a chance to shoot it yet, so I can't comment on how the longer barrel impacts the straightness of the shots, but I can comment on the shroud itself.	30	4	32
144	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	Before I put it on my gun, I disassembled it to put a weaver rail on it for my vertical grip.	30	5	21
145	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	It wasn't too much of a pain to take apart and put back together.	30	6	14
146	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	After screwing the barrel into the gun and adjusting the shroud and sights, I noticed that by holding the grip and putting the slightest amount of pressure on it the shroud would twist left and right.	30	7	36
147	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	The sights were firmly in place.	30	8	6
148	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	I could see this being a huge issue in the middle of a game, so I may ditch the new shroud and sight and go back to the stock Alpha Black shroud (unfortunately).Also, becareful not to overtighten the screws because they screw right into the barrel.	30	9	46
149	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	There's already heavy scratching where the screws dug into the barrel.	30	10	11
150	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	The twisting shroud I mentioned above may also further scratch the barrel - I'm worried overtime this damage may eventually penetrate the barrel.	30	11	22
151	B000F38SZ6	A1SU6TULUNXTY9	Sports & Outdoors	5	So again, another reason to ditch the shroud and go back to the stock parts.	30	12	15
152	B000F38SZ6	A3E9J6FS8T5OS3	Sports & Outdoors	5	"its a great addition to your alpha black it really gives the marker that ""Tacti-cool"" look overall i think its ok I just wish they would make this in a 14"" option..."	31	1	30
153	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	Ok this is a great add on to any 98 and is great for scenario play and what they say is right, it just screws right on.	32	1	26
154	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	But if you go to Ebay, you can get a brand new one, never used, and has more hols in it so it is quieter for half the cost.	32	2	29
155	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	Or you can get the package(barrel stock sight) for $100+$10 shipping when normally the package is about $150.	32	3	17
156	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	I bought mine from WarpedSportsKc and they were great, fast shipping, no problems, and it is an actual Ebay Store so you know it is not just any person trying to get your $.	32	4	33
157	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	They have a 99.9% rating out of like 4000 people.	32	5	8
158	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	So do not buy this from here buy it from Ebay and WarpedSportsKc.	32	6	13
159	B000F38SZ6	A237V9GJCUKAMJ	Sports & Outdoors	5	Just look up their store on Ebay.	32	7	7
160	B000F38SZ6	A1PFEFOJBSH34	Sports & Outdoors	5	"This Barrel is 16"" and works great for long range accuracy."	33	1	10
161	B000F38SZ6	A1PFEFOJBSH34	Sports & Outdoors	5	The price is reasonable and the items that you receive are just fine.After a few uses you have to tighten the bolts back down because it starts to become loose and jiggle.	33	2	31
162	B000F38SZ6	A1PFEFOJBSH34	Sports & Outdoors	5	The site starts to move around and the components on the barrel need to be re-adjusted.	33	3	15
163	B000F38SZ6	A1PFEFOJBSH34	Sports & Outdoors	5	"Not to mention when I got my barrel in the mail, I put it on and it was perfect upside down...I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to impress their friends, but when it comes to function it requires too much fix.I got tired of it and took all the parts off the gun and now simply have a 16"" barrel.When it comes down to it, thanks... but no thanks."	33	4	71
164	B000F38SZ6	A1D2Z8PPKLU3EU	Sports & Outdoors	5	Just is not a good barrel it breaks the balls, the sights are so far off that you can't fix them, it does look cool but I need function	34	1	29
165	B000FH1E0I	A11FBXKE81FYBA	Sports & Outdoors	11	Bought this scope along with UTG rings.	35	1	7
166	B000FH1E0I	A11FBXKE81FYBA	Sports & Outdoors	11	Installed on my AR 15 with no problem.	35	2	7
167	B000FH1E0I	A11FBXKE81FYBA	Sports & Outdoors	11	Great scope for a great price	35	3	6
168	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	I was tired of the iron sights on my RRA AR-15... ordered the Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 Riflescope (Matte, BDC) and it arrived fast.	36	1	21
169	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	Opened up the box, didn't look like anything too special right then and there.	36	2	14
170	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	I took off the reticle, looked nice, sharp, clear indoor looking down my hallway.After a day at the field, I have to tell you guys... it's absolute gold.	36	3	27
171	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	The clarity is amazing, and it has excellent light gathering ability.	36	4	11
172	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	This was especially evident in Washington's sporadic weather, cloudy one second then very bright and sunny the next.	36	5	18
173	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	There wasn't even a hiccup, this scope makes everything easy.The reticle is clear and precise.	36	6	14
174	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	Long story short, right off the bat I was on paper in 2-shots at 100-yards.	36	7	13
175	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	I was zero'ed on bullseye in 4 more.	36	8	6
176	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	A total of 6-shots for zero, right out of the box, at 100 yards.This scope is of very good quality... and thanks to it, my confidence in my own shooting ability has taken a big step up.Cons:- No scope rings included (not a big deal)- Need a flathead screwdriver to adjust elev/windage (again, no bid deal)Just a quick note for those mounting this on an AR-15.	36	9	61
177	B000FH1E0I	A2M4HIZ94OBG4H	Sports & Outdoors	11	If you have an A2 front-sight post... you'll need a riser or high-mount rings for optimum results.I'll be buying another for my other rifles.	36	10	20
178	B000FH1E0I	A1B4IIA0E9SD5F	Sports & Outdoors	11	"Got the scope for my marlin 22wmr went to range today and was shooting 1"" groups in no time."	37	1	17
179	B000FH1E0I	A1B4IIA0E9SD5F	Sports & Outdoors	11	I was really impressed by the clarity on a cloudy day, and the smoothness of the eye relief adjustment for clarity to target was fantastic.The adjustment knobs are very firm and easy to adjust.	37	2	33
180	B000FH1E0I	A1B4IIA0E9SD5F	Sports & Outdoors	11	Overall this scope for the price is excellant.I use a gun vise to hold rifle perfectaly vertical,then check with a level and then check level of scope ring bottoms before setting scope once in place,I set cross hairs to wall target that is perfectally level and by dooing this I have my scope in perfect alignment to the bore of my rifle.	37	3	63
181	B000FH1E0I	A1B4IIA0E9SD5F	Sports & Outdoors	11	Now when I make scope adjustments at the range they are exact,saves on amm for sighting in and has improved my shooting alot.	37	4	24
182	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	The Nikon Prostaff 3-9 with BDC is by far the best scope bargain on the market.	38	1	15
183	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	I picket one up for just under $150 and can't be more happy with my purchase.	38	2	15
184	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	In fact I'm considering replacing my other scope (a Leupold VX-I 3-9) with a Nikon with BDC.I love the BDC feature.	38	3	18
185	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	If used properly it takes all the guess work out of bullet drop.	38	4	13
186	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	Using Nikon's spot on program on the web, you select brand and bullet weight of cartridge you are shooting and plug in your zero distance and it tells you where the BDC circles are zero'd for.	38	5	36
187	B000FH1E0I	A1VOOMCI2NPZ8Y	Sports & Outdoors	11	You print out the table and tape it to your stock and you have custom ballistics tables for any cartridge you want to shoot.Nikon also has the spot on software available for iPhone and Android so now you don't even have to print the tables (carry prints if dont have cell phone service where you hunt).The scope is solid and carries a great warranty plus Nikon is no stranger to quality optics.I'd recommend it to everyone.	38	6	74
188	B000FH1E0I	AR7VRHZ2R3THP	Sports & Outdoors	11	I attached this to my Ruger Mini-14 tactical using Ruger's scope rings.	39	1	11
189	B000FH1E0I	AR7VRHZ2R3THP	Sports & Outdoors	11	The sight was easy to zero and withstood many rounds fired downrange with no loss of zero or any other problems.	39	2	21
190	B000FH1E0I	AR7VRHZ2R3THP	Sports & Outdoors	11	Eye relief could be a little better, and it would be nice not to have to use a penny to make windage adjustments, but you get what you pay for.	39	3	30
191	B000FH1E0I	AR7VRHZ2R3THP	Sports & Outdoors	11	In this case, that's a beautiful, light and functional scope that offers clear optics and great magnification.	39	4	17
223	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	I was hesitant to order a rack that was not made by one of the &#34;Big 2&#34; rack manufacturers, but I didn't want to spend big money for something I thought I would not be using a lot.	46	1	37
224	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	What a nice surprise.	46	2	4
225	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	The quality on this rack is 5-star.	46	3	6
226	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	It mounts easily and removes in seconds.	46	4	7
227	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	Instructions and initial mounting were a breeze.	46	5	7
228	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	We have it mounted on a hatchback Chevy Aveo and it works perfectly.	46	6	13
229	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	The top rubber contact bar is against the glass, and there is so little pressure on that point that you have no worry if your mount requires it to contact the rear glass.	46	7	33
230	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	Nearly all the weight and pressure is on the lower bar.	46	8	11
231	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	The straps and hardware are excellent quality, and the rubber tie-down straps for the bikes are quick and very efficient.	46	9	19
232	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	Take a look at this rack before you spend more money on a name brand.	46	10	15
233	B000QJAFIM	A2L9RNEYPYQA8W	Sports & Outdoors	7	I highly recommend it.	46	11	4
234	B000QJAFIM	A2Q7T4AX31Q2Y5	Sports & Outdoors	7	Was skeptical about purchase but after it arrived was very pleased with ease of installing and how the bike is properly secured.	47	1	22
235	B000QJAFIM	A2Q7T4AX31Q2Y5	Sports & Outdoors	7	This is a very good product.	47	2	6
236	B000QJAFIM	A2Q7T4AX31Q2Y5	Sports & Outdoors	7	Don't hesitate to buy....	47	3	4
237	B000QJAFIM	A26OHN4KVUYULK	Sports & Outdoors	7	Overall very easy to set up, I found that the straps are a little to long so once its tightened to your car (2013 Passat) the straps need to be rolled up and taped up so they dont fling all over the place.	48	1	42
238	B000QJAFIM	A26OHN4KVUYULK	Sports & Outdoors	7	Be careful if your putting on a mountain bike with a rear shock, they dont fill well on this rack.	48	2	20
239	B000QJAFIM	A26OHN4KVUYULK	Sports & Outdoors	7	Regular road bikes work great though.	48	3	6
240	B000QJAFIM	A3VVT9FFZHXCGO	Sports & Outdoors	7	I  bought this to transport my wife and I's mountain bikes.	49	1	11
241	B000QJAFIM	A3VVT9FFZHXCGO	Sports & Outdoors	7	I wasn't sure how this was going to be on the back of my Subaru Crosstrek XV but it mounts very easily, stays put, and the straps do not loosen at all.	49	2	32
242	B000QJAFIM	A3VVT9FFZHXCGO	Sports & Outdoors	7	It accommodates both of our bikes very well and the rubber mounts hold the bikes very well.	49	3	17
243	B000QJAFIM	A3VVT9FFZHXCGO	Sports & Outdoors	7	Very pleased with this purchase.	49	4	5
244	B000QJAFIM	A3VJJK33P4EM1G	Sports & Outdoors	7	Surprisingly Sturdy.	50	1	2
245	B000QJAFIM	A3VJJK33P4EM1G	Sports & Outdoors	7	Easy to use.	50	2	3
246	B000QJAFIM	A3VJJK33P4EM1G	Sports & Outdoors	7	I can put it on in minutes and I can see how it would work on many cars.	50	3	18
247	B000QJAFIM	A3VJJK33P4EM1G	Sports & Outdoors	7	I Love the heavy duty straps.	50	4	6
256	B001UXQXSE	A1CP551C8355WH	Sports & Outdoors	5	Great gag prize at a golf outing.	53	1	7
257	B001UXQXSE	A1CP551C8355WH	Sports & Outdoors	5	Especially if the recipient is bald.	53	2	6
258	B001UXQXSE	A1CP551C8355WH	Sports & Outdoors	5	A bit pricey for a one-time laugh.	53	3	6
259	B001UXQXSE	A1CP551C8355WH	Sports & Outdoors	5	But I suspect this is the type of gag that could be a pass-along that then would get more than one showing.	53	4	21
260	B001UXQXSE	A1CP551C8355WH	Sports & Outdoors	5	In any event it is really a stitch and all it was cracked up to be in the ad where I spotted it first.	53	5	24
261	B001UXQXSE	A2OXTTN0C1LP54	Sports & Outdoors	5	The hair/cap fit without detection.	54	1	4
262	B001UXQXSE	A2OXTTN0C1LP54	Sports & Outdoors	5	I actually like it a lot.	54	2	6
263	B001UXQXSE	A2OXTTN0C1LP54	Sports & Outdoors	5	People who knew me first laughed, then acknowledged that it looked pretty natural.	54	3	13
264	B001UXQXSE	A2OXTTN0C1LP54	Sports & Outdoors	5	People who don't know me, don't even realize that it's a hair/cap - until I take it off to whip my forehead.	54	4	20
265	B001UXQXSE	A2OXTTN0C1LP54	Sports & Outdoors	5	Then it's all laughs!	54	5	4
266	B001UXQXSE	A3QPO44PJFB82R	Sports & Outdoors	5	Bought this as a gag gift for my father in law who is bald... LMFAO!	55	1	15
267	B001UXQXSE	A3QPO44PJFB82R	Sports & Outdoors	5	He got a kick out of it though I don't think he'll wear it out often.	55	2	16
268	B001UXQXSE	A381C6UUUIAB4V	Sports & Outdoors	5	This isn't super high quality, but as a novelty it is fine.	56	1	12
269	B001UXQXSE	A381C6UUUIAB4V	Sports & Outdoors	5	It was well worth the price I paid and will last a while.	56	2	13
270	B001UXQXSE	A1QKHQH3QJCXBN	Sports & Outdoors	5	I got this as a gag gift for my son-in-law.	57	1	9
271	B001UXQXSE	A1QKHQH3QJCXBN	Sports & Outdoors	5	His hair is a little thin.	57	2	6
272	B001UXQXSE	A1QKHQH3QJCXBN	Sports & Outdoors	5	This looks so natural it is scary.	57	3	7
273	B0061PWBLY	AV7HTYJL20C8Q	Sports & Outdoors	46	Working on your AR is fun and easy if you have the right tools.	58	1	14
274	B0061PWBLY	AV7HTYJL20C8Q	Sports & Outdoors	46	These fit the bill.	58	2	4
275	B0061PWBLY	AV7HTYJL20C8Q	Sports & Outdoors	46	Good quality and fit.	58	3	4
276	B0061PWBLY	AV7HTYJL20C8Q	Sports & Outdoors	46	Delivered on time and well packaged.	58	4	6
277	B0061PWBLY	AV7HTYJL20C8Q	Sports & Outdoors	46	Excellent experience.	58	5	2
278	B0061PWBLY	A37FULV9NLQYXU	Sports & Outdoors	46	I think this is a good product.	59	1	7
279	B0061PWBLY	A37FULV9NLQYXU	Sports & Outdoors	46	As others have mentioned, it's for light to medium duty use.	59	2	11
280	B0061PWBLY	A37FULV9NLQYXU	Sports & Outdoors	46	I use it to clean my AR or add/remove optics and such.	59	3	11
281	B0061PWBLY	A37FULV9NLQYXU	Sports & Outdoors	46	The fit is slightly wobbly so I wouldn't torque down on this very much.	59	4	14
282	B0061PWBLY	A37FULV9NLQYXU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Thanks Squirrel Daddy.	59	5	3
283	B0061PWBLY	AK5HBP3X6YWPU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Very happy with these receiver blocks.	60	1	6
284	B0061PWBLY	AK5HBP3X6YWPU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Fit nice and snug to be able to properly torque barrel nuts and other general receiver work.	60	2	17
285	B0061PWBLY	AK5HBP3X6YWPU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Considerably less cost than the competition.	60	3	6
286	B0061PWBLY	AK5HBP3X6YWPU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Have loaned these to friends building ARs and they all have good things to say after using these.	60	4	18
287	B0061PWBLY	AK5HBP3X6YWPU	Sports & Outdoors	46	Very good buy.	60	5	3
288	B0061PWBLY	A1WV34AQB1BX06	Sports & Outdoors	46	These things work great!	61	1	4
289	B0061PWBLY	A1WV34AQB1BX06	Sports & Outdoors	46	would have been impossible to get my barrel nut off my upper without the upper vice block.	61	2	17
290	B0061PWBLY	A1WV34AQB1BX06	Sports & Outdoors	46	If you don't have these yet, get them...now...what are you waiting for.	61	3	14

292	B0061PWBLY	A1KZ45TZV4XUVI	Sports & Outdoors	46	If you need a upper/lower block set, then search no more.	62	2	10
293	B0061PWBLY	A1KZ45TZV4XUVI	Sports & Outdoors	46	Solid metal and super hard plastic.	62	3	6
294	B0061PWBLY	A1KZ45TZV4XUVI	Sports & Outdoors	46	Must have for any AR-15 owner.	62	4	5
422	B008NEFDK2	A1PMXCXLBQCN1V	Sports & Outdoors	14	It is a great foam roller.	104	1	6
423	B008NEFDK2	A1PMXCXLBQCN1V	Sports & Outdoors	14	"I was hoping the ridges would be harder like the OPTP Rumble Roller 31"" x 6""; however, it was actually covered with a much softer foam."	104	2	24
424	B008NEFDK2	A1PMXCXLBQCN1V	Sports & Outdoors	14	This isn't a bad thing, and in fact, makes it a pretty good first roller.	104	3	15
425	B008NEFDK2	A1PMXCXLBQCN1V	Sports & Outdoors	14	"TheBlack High Density Foam Rollers - Extra Firm - 6"" x 36"" Roundare much much more painful.Not that the current seller of this product will add $10 to the price for S&H;."	104	4	27
426	B008NEFDK2	AMKX6DOLN802U	Sports & Outdoors	14	Can definitely recommend this to others looking for a roller.	105	1	10
427	B008NEFDK2	AMKX6DOLN802U	Sports & Outdoors	14	Offers a a different massage than your standard foam roller which I also have and like to alternate.	105	2	18
428	B008NEFDK2	AMK7WMZ5YECFI	Sports & Outdoors	14	Works alright but i think it should be a tad smaller diameter to make it easier to roll on.	106	1	19
429	B008NEFDK2	A2V9AWT90S20R	Sports & Outdoors	14	I this works ok, the &#34;fingers&#34; do not really have any effect.	107	1	12
430	B008NEFDK2	A2V9AWT90S20R	Sports & Outdoors	14	I bet there are better products but for the price this is great	107	2	13
431	B008NEFDK2	A3NU0DF5ZDL1EB	Sports & Outdoors	14	does all that a foam roller should do.	108	1	8
432	B008NEFDK2	A3NU0DF5ZDL1EB	Sports & Outdoors	14	gets rid of tight muscles and helps with flexibility, good if you just want a nice back cracking	108	2	18
489	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	Came across a klean kanteen at Goodwill.	118	1	7
490	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	Didn't have a lid with it.	118	3	6
491	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	Would have replaced it anyway.	118	4	5
492	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	A little vinegar.	118	5	3
493	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	A little soap.	118	6	3
494	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	With the new lid, it looks as good as the day it was made!	118	7	14
495	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	All-around well-made product(s).	118	8	2
496	B0093IKQT0	ABI5KIHILDCP1	Sports & Outdoors	5	Total investment = less than $10.	118	9	4
497	B0093IKQT0	A1A00WVJM7Q14D	Sports & Outdoors	5	Nice cap fit was perfect, I like the color also, easy to clean.	119	1	13
498	B0093IKQT0	A1A00WVJM7Q14D	Sports & Outdoors	5	I would buy again for sure.	119	2	6
499	B0093IKQT0	A1A00WVJM7Q14D	Sports & Outdoors	5	Thanks from Ohio	119	3	3
500	B0093IKQT0	A24FQNZ2ZCP9UH	Sports & Outdoors	5	My Klean Kanteen bottles came with the sports top.	120	1	9
501	B0093IKQT0	A24FQNZ2ZCP9UH	Sports & Outdoors	5	They sports top isn't leak proof so I wanted to get a top that would keep the water in the bottle.	120	2	21
502	B0093IKQT0	A24FQNZ2ZCP9UH	Sports & Outdoors	5	This top seals perfect and does the job.	120	3	8
503	B0093IKQT0	A24FQNZ2ZCP9UH	Sports & Outdoors	5	I just switch the top when I'm at the gym to the sports top.	120	4	14
504	B0093IKQT0	A24FQNZ2ZCP9UH	Sports & Outdoors	5	Not a big deal.	120	5	4
505	B0093IKQT0	A3PFNAOW11FTRC	Sports & Outdoors	5	I bought this to replace the sport cap which leaks when not closed properly.	121	1	14
506	B0093IKQT0	A3PFNAOW11FTRC	Sports & Outdoors	5	My 2.5 yr old can tighten the cap and bottle does not leak.	121	2	12
507	B0093IKQT0	A3PFNAOW11FTRC	Sports & Outdoors	5	However, she needs help to open the bottle.	121	3	8
508	B0093IKQT0	A3PFNAOW11FTRC	Sports & Outdoors	5	I still prefer this over the sports cap.	121	4	8
509	B0093IKQT0	A3H8UG5U16ZY1U	Sports & Outdoors	5	this is my favorite cap for small mouth bottles, doesn't leak and quiet to use if you are in a meeting	122	1	21
510	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	Seriously though, it is a nice rack!	123	1	7
511	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	It fits perfectly on my 2006 Mustang convertible and best of all the bike doesn't touch the car and the rack only touches the tires so no chance of scratching/damaging my carbon frame!.	123	2	31
512	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	The only glitch is that the rack says it fits a 1 1/4&#34; receiver; what it doesn't say is that it has to be a CLASS II not Class I.	123	3	28
513	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	My car can only fit a class I.	123	4	8
514	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	This was easily remedied by the hitch installation shop grinding off the stop that keeps the rack from inserting in too far.	123	5	22
515	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	I learned the distance from the pin hole to the stop is 1 5/8&#34; on a class I and 2&#34; on a Class II.	123	6	21
516	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	No big deal!	123	7	3
517	B009SM5IR6	A19SPPBZVIOGLS	Sports & Outdoors	7	All in all I love it and would definitely recommend it!	123	8	11
518	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I got this rack to replace a roof rack that was sapping gas mileage, and cause too much wind noise.	124	1	20
519	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	Plus my 40lb freeride bike would wave in the breeze laterally on the roof mount.	124	2	14
520	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	The hold-up is very solid in the 1.25&#34; format.	124	3	7
521	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I have no concerns about it bending or sagging over time with a couple of heavy bikes.	124	4	17
522	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I like that it folds up and out of the way when not in use.	124	5	15
523	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	Assembly was pretty straight forward.	124	6	5
524	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I did set the trays at their maximum offset to each side which centered by bike very well.	124	7	18
525	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	No issues with handle bar/seat clearance.	124	8	5
526	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	The cable lock is a very minor deterrent for thieves.	124	9	10
527	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I recommend a heavier cable with a padlock threaded through the hitch, frame, and both wheels if you're leaving you bike on the rack unsupervised.	124	10	25
528	B009SM5IR6	ARMYZUMK3VQM4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I looked forward to years of used from this rack.	124	11	10
529	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	Yakima keeps making continued improvements which makes this particular rack better and better.	125	1	13
530	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	I had the original model with the clevis pin spine, that was a pain to use and lacked any tilt.	125	2	20
531	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	Yakima then brought out a new spine which added a quick release pin, and downward tilt.	125	3	16
532	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	My gripe with both of the older models was the lack of adjustability to avoid handlebars from hitting the opposite side seat.	125	4	22
533	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	This new model takes the improvements of the tilt, and couples it with adjustability to slide the trays back and forth to avoid the interference of the handlebars.	125	5	28
534	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	This adjustability makes this rack just about perfect.	125	6	8
535	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	Another important benefit for Yakima is the compact footprint when folded up.	125	7	12
536	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	Compared to other brands, the Yakima folds up to create a smaller cross section which does or obstruct the tail lights of a smaller width vehicle like my Outback.	125	8	29
537	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	Add the new stealthy black paint and red decals, and this is easily the best looking rack out there.	125	9	19
538	B009SM5IR6	A176SH7UY3AJCT	Sports & Outdoors	7	The new arms with the locking cables built into them are a welcome addition in lieu of the cable that was included with the older model.	125	10	26
539	B009SM5IR6	A19ZJINBXOBOO4	Sports & Outdoors	7	I am sure this rack is great but the Amazon description did not state that it is not compatibile with Class I hitches.	126	1	23
540	B009SM5IR6	A19ZJINBXOBOO4	Sports & Outdoors	7	Mounting with one is possible but requires you to cut the shank which I did not want to do should I need to return it later	126	2	26
541	B009SM5IR6	A11PQR03PP428U	Sports & Outdoors	7	This rack was easy to assemble and even easier to use!	127	1	11
542	B009SM5IR6	A11PQR03PP428U	Sports & Outdoors	7	By far the best and easiest rack to use.	127	2	9
585	B00I0HQ4MS	A390XPHE9J7DBO	Sports & Outdoors	44	These were a gift and my friend who lifts said these are one of the best he has tried.	130	1	19
586	B00I0HQ4MS	A1VRVXIL9WF47J	Sports & Outdoors	44	soft hands and hard muscles, these gloves will protect your hands as you work out.	131	1	15
587	B00I0HQ4MS	A1VRVXIL9WF47J	Sports & Outdoors	44	the extra support on the wrists is great	131	2	8
588	B00I0HQ4MS	A24MUR7JGFFAXF	Sports & Outdoors	44	Firsts like a glove and seems to be of great quality as well.I liked the way I could pick the right size so easily.	132	1	23
589	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	I can't believe how wonderfully these fit!	133	1	7
590	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	I am very impressed with the feel and overall quality!	133	2	10
591	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	The super stretchy wraps ensure a snug fit that still allows for great range of motion.	133	3	16
592	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	The measurements were spot on.	133	4	5
593	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	I am looking forward to using these great gloves in my weight lifting for a long time to come!Seller is great, start to finish.	133	5	25
594	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	Super happy to get them in TWO DAYS with Prime!!	133	6	10
595	B00I0HQ4MS	AWFGKB5SCJAO2	Sports & Outdoors	44	Thank you!	133	7	2
596	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	The B Nooch work out gloves were a surprise.	134	1	9
597	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	Normally, when I buy workout gloves, I look for 2 things: Durability and Wrist supports.	134	2	14
598	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	Typically other brand gloves will not have both and when they do have both, normally the durability is always in question and they rip and tear fairly easy.	134	3	28
599	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	These gloves have both the durability and the wrist supports without the ripping and tearing.They have a snug fit and I was surprised at the quality.	134	4	25
600	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	I have had gloves in the past that a few days after I buy them, the threading from the Velcro area starts to loosen.	134	5	24
601	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	The B Nooch gloves offer very tight threading and I have seen no signs of the threads loosening.	134	6	18
602	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	The wrist strap offers the extra support needed for those heavier lifts.	134	7	12
603	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	The cushioning around the palm could have been a little thicker, but overall, I would easily say one of the better gloves on the market.	134	8	25
604	B00I0HQ4MS	A3AYSYSLHU26U9	Sports & Outdoors	44	Designed to last for a very long time.B Nooch offers a one year no-hassle replacement guarantee.Sample for review purposes.	134	9	16
