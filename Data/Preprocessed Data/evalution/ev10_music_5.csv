0	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	I ordered three of these ...so far!Very affordable and good quality.	1	1	12
1	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	Made in Canada.Keeps wireless unit very snug and tight.Easy in and out with Velcro retaining strap.	1	2	14
2	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	(all leather.	1	3	2
3	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	)I use the little plastic flat ring on the bottom to loop my strap through which keeps it tight against the guitar strap.The width of the slots are 1 inch and 1/16&#34; or approximately 27 mm wide.	1	4	33
4	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	The leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit.These are much better than I suspected and have a few expensive Levy's classic padded straps.	1	5	28
5	B00074B67A	A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ	Music & Instruments	5	They fit each other like a glove and are very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdy.If you click on the item and go to the product page I have uploaded some photos of actual use and close-ups.	1	6	36
6	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap.	2	1	26
7	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	Way too small, maybe like a third of the width.	2	2	10
8	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit.	2	3	13
9	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely.	2	4	10
10	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something.UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly.	2	5	28
11	B00074B67A	A3K6M4WXNTYQEM	Music & Instruments	5	But you need to attach it with something.	2	6	8
12	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	I really like it!!!!!	3	1	4
13	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	You have to have a Levy's strap to use this but since they are the most durable and comfortable I already own two of them.	3	2	25
14	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	I never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor.	3	3	11
15	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	I check the battery level when I am not playing, the strap goes over the leds, but that is a minor issue.	3	4	22
16	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	Most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries.	3	5	10
17	B00074B67A	A23HJIRA5PIMG0	Music & Instruments	5	I always use new ones so I know I have way more juice then I need for my practice or whatever.This is very ruggedly made I think it will last for ever.	3	6	31
18	B00074B67A	A2MIP3AQVSF2SS	Music & Instruments	5	What's most impressive isn't the top-drawer leather and craftsmanship -- that goes without saying from Levy's.	4	1	14
19	B00074B67A	A2MIP3AQVSF2SS	Music & Instruments	5	it's the clever design, the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap, adjusts to almost any position, and adjusts to (almost) any small wireless transmitter.	4	2	26
20	B00074B67A	A2MIP3AQVSF2SS	Music & Instruments	5	transmitter, not receiver!	4	3	3
21	B00074B67A	A1OGTL9EBDTK3N	Music & Instruments	5	I like it that it fits well on my strap and that it has a good snug hold on the receiver	5	1	21
22	B000A1HU1G	A3CUYX2VXZM9KO	Music & Instruments	5	I was looking for a thin crash on a budget and I gave this company a try and I couldnt be more happy..I had reservations at first but when I installed it on my set and used it today I was very surprised..	6	1	44
23	B000A1HU1G	A3CUYX2VXZM9KO	Music & Instruments	5	It hasa great hissing crash that lingers a bit as a much more expensive cymbal would have.	6	2	17
24	B000A1HU1G	A3CUYX2VXZM9KO	Music & Instruments	5	This companyputs out a good cymbal and I have a combination of all of the top line names on my set.	6	3	21
25	B000A1HU1G	APVLFUAI3IDF7	Music & Instruments	5	It's made from China, but very please for me, sound so warm and vibration much better than famous brand.	7	1	19
26	B000A1HU1G	APVLFUAI3IDF7	Music & Instruments	5	Will buy again with other size.	7	2	6
27	B000A1HU1G	APVLFUAI3IDF7	Music & Instruments	5	Which 6 stars.	7	3	2
28	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all 9 cymbals that I possess and use.	8	1	15
29	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	very brilliant and resonant, definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price.	8	2	16
30	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	trust this cymbal once and you won't be disappointed.	8	3	9
31	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	it lasts a pretty long while too.	8	4	7
32	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	it's a thin splash so it does tend to break after about 8 months of use er so, but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there.	8	5	31
33	B000A1HU1G	A2F42NSN3HKRCU	Music & Instruments	5	all in all I definitely recommend trying this product	8	6	9
34	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	Wuhan makes great products for the money.	9	1	7
35	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	I have the 18&#34; medium crash and so I decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck.	9	2	19
36	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	If you close your eyes you would swear you were using a Zylgian from the 60's or 70's.	9	3	16
37	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	Nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals,  With any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 Wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash.	9	4	71
38	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	Will review each one as they come in from Amazon.	9	5	10
39	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	Why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like I am, go for Wuhans.	9	6	26
40	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	I have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash.	9	7	19
41	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	Wuhan really impresses me.	9	8	4
42	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	There are some great video's of Wuhans on You Tube, you should really check those out before buying Wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter.	9	9	25
43	B000A1HU1G	AFS3FQR5JSDVJ	Music & Instruments	5	I am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash!	9	10	7
44	B000A1HU1G	A1OGTL9EBDTK3N	Music & Instruments	5	Nice cymbal, better price .	10	1	4
45	B000A1HU1G	A1OGTL9EBDTK3N	Music & Instruments	5	I'm no Metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag .	10	2	19
46	B000AAGM0M	A2SBZZ1HSR7WSP	Music & Instruments	15	In my house alone we have a bass player, a acoustic guitar player, a sax player and a violinist, that is not counting myself (I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica, usually I fail) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history, I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice, the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty.just be sure to buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing.	11	1	124
47	B000AAGM0M	A1H55L0BLPCWYF	Music & Instruments	15	I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning.The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it.I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card.	12	1	152
48	B000AAGM0M	A165EMA3YTIM6A	Music & Instruments	15	I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome.	13	1	16
49	B000AAGM0M	A165EMA3YTIM6A	Music & Instruments	15	I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion.	13	2	17
50	B000AAGM0M	A165EMA3YTIM6A	Music & Instruments	15	Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more.	13	3	24
51	B000AAGM0M	A165EMA3YTIM6A	Music & Instruments	15	However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes.	13	4	18
52	B000AAGM0M	A165EMA3YTIM6A	Music & Instruments	15	For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices.	13	5	24
53	B000AAGM0M	A1LHMSY3Q46PJS	Music & Instruments	15	I've owned this and a couple of other Korge Tuners in the past, and currently own three.In the past I would use a keyboard to get the bottom E on my guitar and take it from there.	14	1	36
54	B000AAGM0M	A1LHMSY3Q46PJS	Music & Instruments	15	These days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive I keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when I go out with my guitars.	14	2	29
55	B000AAGM0M	A1LHMSY3Q46PJS	Music & Instruments	15	I also use it to tune my violin, and it works great.If you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better.Over all for the cost you can't go wrong.	14	3	29
56	B000AAGM0M	A1LHMSY3Q46PJS	Music & Instruments	15	These used to be expensive none-essentials, but today they're small accurate and portable.	14	4	12
57	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model.	15	1	8
58	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package.	15	2	11
59	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune).	15	3	15
60	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc).	15	4	14
61	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price.	15	5	16
62	B000AAGM0M	A2R4YQNCYMS8M7	Music & Instruments	15	Very happy with it!	15	6	4
118	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	The Behringer ACX-450 is a good looking, great sounding amp in a small package, but should be used at low to medium volume.	26	1	22
119	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	"At higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange, and also use the anti-feedback button, to avoid a ""muddy"" sound from too much (distorted?)"	26	2	30
120	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	This not an amp to play loudly, but rather for low-to-mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue.As to the sound effects, it is great with 16 effects covering reverb, chorus, delay/echo and many combinations.	26	4	30
121	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	I especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel.	26	5	17
122	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	Also nice to have a separate XLR microphone input on channel 2.The CD/MP3 input is good for backgrounds (or maybe drum machine) when playing, or music during breaks, although one needs a cable with RCA plugs to connect it.	26	6	37
123	B000LAT0AK	A1S7QABO64Z554	Music & Instruments	5	Lack of a headphone jack is a drawback, but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offers.Overall, a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price, if you don't plan to crank it up too much!	26	7	40
124	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	I have been using the Behringer ACX450 for six months now.	27	1	10
125	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	I was impressed early, and still am very satisfied with the performance.	27	2	12
126	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	It is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects.	27	3	12
127	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	One would have to be filling a large venue to need more than this quality amp can provide.	27	4	18
128	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	I'm running preamps from Gibson J45 and a Taylor 114 ce and they both sound amazing and I don't even know what to do with the rest of the gain.	27	5	28
129	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	The music from these instruments is clear, bright, deep and the sound is a great reproduction of the instruments themselves.	27	6	20
130	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	Behringer's mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price.	27	7	14
131	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	"I say, ""mission accomplished""."	27	8	4
132	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	Amazon was seamless to work with and with free fast shipping the whole experience has been great.	27	9	17
133	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	Man, how did we get by before things were so cool and easy.	27	10	13
134	B000LAT0AK	A26E1V45R24QVC	Music & Instruments	5	Push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep.	27	11	11
135	B000LAT0AK	AA4BAIDEDJI3	Music & Instruments	5	Great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless.	28	1	10
136	B000LAT0AK	AA4BAIDEDJI3	Music & Instruments	5	Unless you have a mixer, you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this.	28	2	16
137	B000LAT0AK	AA4BAIDEDJI3	Music & Instruments	5	Really puts out the sound though, and I guess that's what you get an amp for!	28	3	16
138	B000LAT0AK	AA4BAIDEDJI3	Music & Instruments	5	I used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 2-3 to fill the place.	28	4	20
139	B000LAT0AK	AA4BAIDEDJI3	Music & Instruments	5	Very nice effects on both channels.	28	5	6
140	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	I am so happy with this amp.	29	1	7
141	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	I've had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing.	29	2	13
142	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	On a couple of occasions, I have plugged in my acoustic, my mic, and my buddies mic, and it still handled the load and sounded good.	29	3	26
143	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	I'm impressed.	29	4	2
144	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	I even have a Digitech pedal that I use with my Fender Strat, and it sounds amazing.	29	5	17
145	B000LAT0AK	ACFBLRCKLPR00	Music & Instruments	5	I highly recommend this amp.	29	6	5
146	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	This amp sounds great, looks great, works great and is a breath of fresh air from &#34;modelling&#34; amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through.	30	1	33
147	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	This Behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five &#34;flavor&#34; settings in each.	30	2	15
148	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	They are all on one dial and there is no pushing, pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you've switched gears.	30	3	24
149	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	Here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty.	30	4	20
150	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	There is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar.	30	5	40
151	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	The foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar, microphone for singing, drum machine.	30	6	21
152	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	The EQ sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set.	30	7	33
153	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	I've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned--it's velcroed on there just fine.	30	8	20
154	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	The cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material.	30	9	9
155	B000LAT0AK	A1WJBJUQ24G8BU	Music & Instruments	5	Plenty loud.	30	10	2
156	B000RY68PA	A3M05N9UWHIXUI	Music & Instruments	9	I bought these xlr cables for my mobile DJ rig and they perform flawlessly.	31	1	14
157	B000RY68PA	A3M05N9UWHIXUI	Music & Instruments	9	The contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality.	31	2	14
158	B000RY68PA	A3M05N9UWHIXUI	Music & Instruments	9	Buy with confidence.	31	3	3
159	B000RY68PA	A17IU5NX3UC84G	Music & Instruments	9	Colors help keep track of what is going into where.	32	1	10
160	B000RY68PA	A17IU5NX3UC84G	Music & Instruments	9	And the build quality is solid.	32	2	6
161	B000RY68PA	A17IU5NX3UC84G	Music & Instruments	9	I was warned about the shielding but I haven't experienced an issues yet.	32	3	13
162	B000RY68PA	AQT4V74P38PPU	Music & Instruments	9	Good quality cables , bright colors make identification easy when hooking up to a mixer , this makes it easy to follow whats going to where , good connectors and nice flexible cable , does the job very well, with care they should hold up well , thumbs up for GLS	33	1	46
163	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	I've used GLS products before and they are good quality for a fair price.	34	1	14
164	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	Their microphones do a great job for little cost.	34	2	9
165	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	I've been impressed.	34	3	3
166	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	These cables didn't disappoint me, either.	34	4	6
167	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	Don't judge their products on price alone.	34	5	7
168	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	Try them first.	34	6	3
169	B000RY68PA	A34LQ791ACZ0JC	Music & Instruments	9	You will be pleased and your bank account will thank you.	34	7	11
170	B000RY68PA	A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y	Music & Instruments	9	The construction of this set is superb.	35	1	7
171	B000RY68PA	A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y	Music & Instruments	9	The ends have heavy duty strain reliefs, and the XLR connectors are well made and perfectly mate with receptacles on the devices being patched.Probably the biggest plus is the cable itself, which appears to be heavy gauge - certainly thicker than my other patch sets - and built to last.In addition, I love the attention to detail in the form of color coding, which makes tracing cables behind the rack a lot easier.I have patch cables from different brands and this set does stand out for its quality when compared to the others.	35	2	88
172	B000RY68PA	A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y	Music & Instruments	9	And the price is so close to the more generic ones that I have been using that I am switching over to this brand for my future needs.	35	3	28
182	B000WN4J9S	A1LQC225SE8UNI	Music & Instruments	16	This neck plate rides on the body of a Mexico-made Jazz Bass which I acquired second-hand, replacing the blank factory plate.	40	1	19
183	B000WN4J9S	A1LQC225SE8UNI	Music & Instruments	16	It could be thicker -- it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up.	40	2	13
184	B000WN4J9S	A1LQC225SE8UNI	Music & Instruments	16	Still, the guitar now sports the old Sixties Fender &#34;F&#34; logo.	40	3	11
185	B000WN4J9S	A36OSNJ4YJSGEP	Music & Instruments	16	I was upgrading all the chrome on a MIM and put this on.	41	1	13
186	B000WN4J9S	A36OSNJ4YJSGEP	Music & Instruments	16	Looks better than the plain one.	41	2	6
187	B000WN4J9S	A36OSNJ4YJSGEP	Music & Instruments	16	Includes the screws.	41	3	3
188	B000WN4J9S	APB6VJX5CNR5C	Music & Instruments	16	"I have purchased three of the Fender ""f"" neck plates for three different MIM Strats."	42	1	15
189	B000WN4J9S	APB6VJX5CNR5C	Music & Instruments	16	They all went on easy, caused no problem and they look really cool.	42	2	13
190	B000WN4J9S	A1DVUFG2QSJ6IK	Music & Instruments	16	It is a Fender product, so it is well made.	43	1	10
191	B000WN4J9S	A1DVUFG2QSJ6IK	Music & Instruments	16	Reasonably priced.	43	2	2
192	B000WN4J9S	A1DVUFG2QSJ6IK	Music & Instruments	16	It will make any Strat or Tele build shine.	43	3	9
193	B000WN4J9S	A3A3ZCWP7Z4V4K	Music & Instruments	16	It looks nice on our Fender Blacktop Bass plus the locks, it completely changed the look of the bass, details	44	1	20
228	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	It's a pop filter.	56	1	4
229	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	In case one wasn't good enough, they double it up!	56	2	10
230	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	Works great.	56	3	2
231	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	No complaints whatsoever.	56	4	3
232	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	No need for a fancy pansy $50 metal mesh screen.	56	5	9
233	B001E3SFKO	A2C2TKHICAZ4RS	Music & Instruments	5	This works just as good.	56	6	5
234	B001E3SFKO	A13798OPDBLDCO	Music & Instruments	5	This pop filter does the trick everyone is blown away to see a double filter.	57	1	15
235	B001E3SFKO	A13798OPDBLDCO	Music & Instruments	5	It is still made out of plastic and can be quite easy to crack when trying to position but as long as your carefully it should last for awhile.	57	2	29
236	B001E3SFKO	A1NAA1R38JSNHV	Music & Instruments	5	Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone.	58	1	16
237	B001E3SFKO	A1NAA1R38JSNHV	Music & Instruments	5	And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more.	58	2	12
238	B001E3SFKO	A1NAA1R38JSNHV	Music & Instruments	5	It's simply amazing.	58	3	3
239	B001E3SFKO	A1NAA1R38JSNHV	Music & Instruments	5	Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter.	58	4	10
240	B001E3SFKO	A1NAA1R38JSNHV	Music & Instruments	5	If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves.	58	5	24
241	B001E3SFKO	A3QK723XT3MJXZ	Music & Instruments	5	Works exceptionally well.	59	1	3
242	B001E3SFKO	A3QK723XT3MJXZ	Music & Instruments	5	In fact, this works better than regular, single-layered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice.Well worth the money.	59	2	38
243	B001E3SFKO	A3QK723XT3MJXZ	Music & Instruments	5	The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands.	59	3	19
244	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	Very nice pop filter!	60	1	4
245	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	I use it on all my condenser mics!	60	2	8
246	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	It works perfect for those hard P's and strong S sounds.	60	3	11
247	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	It's built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand.	60	4	11
248	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	It makes DeEssing a lot simpler when mixing vocals.	60	5	9
249	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	And it looks very professional!	60	6	5
250	B001E3SFKO	A2H629SI5VJGRM	Music & Instruments	5	I wouldn't be on the mic without it, now that I know of the big difference it makes having it!	60	7	20
251	B001Q8DJO4	AYQ46BHSK99YV	Music & Instruments	7	really nice I found them easy to put on and to use on the guitar and easy to play.	61	1	19
252	B001Q8DJO4	A223S6N0DBQBHP	Music & Instruments	7	I've been buying these strings for a while now.	62	1	9
253	B001Q8DJO4	A223S6N0DBQBHP	Music & Instruments	7	They sound clean and crisp.	62	2	5
254	B001Q8DJO4	A223S6N0DBQBHP	Music & Instruments	7	The best part is the price.	62	3	6
255	B001Q8DJO4	A1P9JI4TR933JX	Music & Instruments	7	Great for beginners and experts.	63	1	5
256	B001Q8DJO4	A1P9JI4TR933JX	Music & Instruments	7	The sound is great and is easy on the fingers.	63	2	10
257	B001Q8DJO4	A1P9JI4TR933JX	Music & Instruments	7	I got them recommended by a friend	63	3	7
258	B001Q8DJO4	A35CRCL7WVUCYG	Music & Instruments	7	I like purchasing the 3 pack because I have multiple guitars and these were replacement strings.	64	1	15
259	B001Q8DJO4	A35CRCL7WVUCYG	Music & Instruments	7	You can't beat the price.	64	2	5
260	B001Q8DJO4	A35CRCL7WVUCYG	Music & Instruments	7	I have started purchasing a lot of my guitar supplies this way.	64	3	12
261	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	I am not a fussy person about guitar strings.	65	1	9
262	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	They either sound good or they don't to you and you are the one that matters.	65	2	16
263	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door.	65	3	15
264	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside.	65	4	22
265	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	Martin is at the top of the heap.	65	5	8
266	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	These strings sound light and bright.	65	6	6
267	B001Q8DJO4	A3MZWM75KSM1P6	Music & Instruments	7	Very pleased with this purchase.	65	7	5
273	B007T8CUNG	A1ZQVN0F0FURHH	Music & Instruments	16	very nice compressor.	68	1	3
274	B007T8CUNG	A1ZQVN0F0FURHH	Music & Instruments	16	I leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone/sustain.	68	2	12
275	B007T8CUNG	A1ZQVN0F0FURHH	Music & Instruments	16	Can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing.	68	3	16
276	B007T8CUNG	A1ZQVN0F0FURHH	Music & Instruments	16	Quiet - much quieter than other compressors in this price range.	68	4	10
277	B007T8CUNG	A1ZQVN0F0FURHH	Music & Instruments	16	No concerns here	68	5	3
278	B007T8CUNG	A3EYCAYIIBDXUF	Music & Instruments	16	Fantastic pedal, especially considering the price.	69	1	6
279	B007T8CUNG	A3EYCAYIIBDXUF	Music & Instruments	16	Prior to this pedal, I've used an MXR Dyna Comp and a TC Electronics Nova Dynamics compressor.	69	2	17
280	B007T8CUNG	A3EYCAYIIBDXUF	Music & Instruments	16	This is low-noise compared to the MXR and simple to use.	69	3	10
281	B007T8CUNG	A3EYCAYIIBDXUF	Music & Instruments	16	It doesn't get as &#34;squashy&#34; as other compressors, so don't plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output.	69	4	30
282	B007T8CUNG	A27DR1VO079F1V	Music & Instruments	16	I'm sold.	70	1	2
283	B007T8CUNG	A27DR1VO079F1V	Music & Instruments	16	I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.	70	2	25
284	B007T8CUNG	A2YQTEPCGZ5N7J	Music & Instruments	16	Very transparent, with great sustain and a hint of &#34;dirty&#34; boost if you crank the knobs to max.Built well, sounds good and does what you'd expect.	71	1	25
285	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time.	72	1	27
286	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor.	72	2	14
287	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato.	72	3	29
288	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them.	72	4	33
289	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	This thing simply didn't work right out of the box.	72	5	10
290	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China.	72	6	21
291	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board.	72	7	10
292	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	I ended up sending it back for a full refund.	72	8	10
293	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	I don't in anyway blame the seller.	72	9	7
294	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it.	72	10	23
295	B007T8CUNG	AJNFQI3YR6XJ5	Music & Instruments	16	If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for.	72	11	19
359	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	This is a modeling amp.	84	1	5
360	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	IT has several presets, to emulate different sounds.	84	2	8
361	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	They factory settings for these are pretty good, and all but the first bank (of three) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp.	84	3	27
362	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	If you get the fender fuse software (license comes with the amp) you can get some pretty amazing &#34;pre&#34; sets from fender and other users.This is not a massive cabinet, so you aren't going to get that &#34;big&#34; a sound, regardless.	84	4	40
363	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	But for a small room it's great!Common complaint I have seen:  No clean channel/preset.This is not the case.	84	5	18
364	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	There are a couple of factory presets that are &#34;clean&#34; although some people want cleaner.	84	6	15
365	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums.	84	7	20
366	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	That said, one of my guitars is edgy, it wants to overdrive the amp.	84	8	14
367	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	Another doesn't, and is very clean, even on the factory preset clean.I very nearly got a different amp.	84	9	17
368	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II.	84	10	14
369	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I!!	84	11	21
370	B00BTGMI5O	A13TQHVN7WBUPD	Music & Instruments	6	For ~$100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for.It'll keep me busy for a long time.	84	12	19
371	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	I bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar.	85	1	11
372	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	There is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state (this is a solid state).	85	2	17
373	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	People will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a $400 tube amp to practice through.	85	3	17
374	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	(&#34;You're not getting the right tone, man....&#34; The problem with that is, there are several companies out there Marshall, Fender, Vox, Orange, etc....and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one.	85	4	44
375	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	So, I figured, before I committed to a company, maybe I could just use this Fender to emulate some of those sounds I want.That worked out beautifully.	85	5	26
376	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	Though I am very much a beginner, I have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp's eq can have on your guitar's tone.	85	6	24
377	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	I thought I needed pedals to have some of these effects, instead I can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger/reverb/modulation I need.	85	7	28
378	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	I have got to the point where I understand about how just adjusting my volume/switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when I want to.I would not have been able to do that without this amp.	85	8	44
379	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	This amp helped me develop as a beginner so I wouldn't waste money buying other things, beginners think they should get.	85	9	21
380	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	Excellent amp and I recommend getting this over the Mustang II.	85	10	11
381	B00BTGMI5O	AXMYGK3WC8BPP	Music & Instruments	6	Save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more.	85	11	17
382	B00BTGMI5O	A2U1Z3TZ4P76JB	Music & Instruments	6	I bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter, as she is learning to play.	86	1	17
383	B00BTGMI5O	A2U1Z3TZ4P76JB	Music & Instruments	6	My son has also joined in the fun.	86	2	8
384	B00BTGMI5O	A2U1Z3TZ4P76JB	Music & Instruments	6	This is a pretty complex amp, and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do.	86	3	22
385	B00BTGMI5O	A2U1Z3TZ4P76JB	Music & Instruments	6	It can be a little daunting for a newbie.	86	4	9
386	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	My first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it.	87	1	16
387	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	I couldn't get it to sound like I wanted it to.....I WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARS...I must now rerate it with a 5 star.	87	2	28
388	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	This amp does almost too much for the money.	87	3	9
389	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has.	87	4	29
390	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it too.WOW, I never knew my guitar could sound like this.	87	5	20
391	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have.	87	6	13
392	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out, if I ever do.	87	7	25
393	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings.So, in short, forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early.	87	8	27
394	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it.	87	9	13
395	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	If you are looking for a small, plug and play amp...this isn't it.	87	10	14
396	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	But it you're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities.	87	11	11
397	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	this IS it.	87	12	3
398	B00BTGMI5O	A15TYOEWBQYF0X	Music & Instruments	6	It is growing on me and I wouldn't part with it now.	87	13	12
399	B00BTGMI5O	APXEAZI8E8GES	Music & Instruments	6	Luv it, I had version #1 and this amp isnt much different.they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software	88	1	24
