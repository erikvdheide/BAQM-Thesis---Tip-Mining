10	B000DZTS2I	A1DDWJ44U308J4	Baby	75	The other brand names start out at $60 at least!	3	2	9

22	B000DZTS2I	AF9OYN557Z77I	Baby	75	Its also an amazing price compared to other slings and I think this one works just as well.	4	5	18
23	B000DZTS2I	AF9OYN557Z77I	Baby	75	Its worth giving a try b/c the price is right.	4	6	9
24	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	I haven't tried this with my newborn yet, but I used this sling ALL THE TIME with my other baby!	5	1	20
25	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	I had my last two babies close together (13 months apart), and toward the end was stuck with a baby who couldn't walk while I was in my very uncomfortable third trimester.	5	2	31
26	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	This sling was a LIFESAVER.	5	3	5
27	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	It has enough length/slack that I could put my baby in (she was about 10 months the first time I used it)and adjust the sling so that she was not sitting right on my stomach.	5	4	34
28	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	It's also VERY easy to get on and off, especially off.	5	5	11
29	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	Removing a baby sling, whether a baby is in it or not, seems to always be the hard part.	5	6	19
30	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	This sling comes off easy as a wink, and if you have your baby in it, it's just as easy.	5	7	20
31	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	The padded shoulder is also a very nice perk, and it pads nicely without adding a lot of bulk.I am looking forward to using this sling again, and will be getting on the maker's website soon to see how to carry my newborn in it safely.	5	8	45
32	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	I'd absolutely recommend it to a mom needing a sling.	5	9	10
33	B000DZTS2I	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	75	I've tried several different styles and brands, and this is so far my favorite!	5	10	14
535	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	As an infant my son liked this chair but not nearly as much as he liked his swing.	76	1	18
536	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	He liked to be in motion and if he was in this chair I would usually have to sit next to him and rock (as opposed to a bouncer where his own movements were strong enough to cause rocking).	76	2	39
537	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	I tried rocking it with my foot so that I could eat while keeping him in the chair but it was not comfortable.	76	3	23
538	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	Now at 6 months he likes to practice standing next to it while holding on to it, but in all honesty he doesn't really like sitting anywhere at this stage.	76	4	29
539	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	I expect him to like it again as he is a little older (his older cousins go nuts with it when visiting).	76	5	22
540	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	He totally didn't care about the vibrating function but absolutely loved the puppy - too bad the melody is less than a minute so I'd have to keep pulling it for him.Bird toy - once he realized that if he pulls hard enough he can get it out of the socket it became his favorite toy.	76	6	53
541	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	One danger is that as he pulls on it when it comes out the momentum can carry it to smack him in the head.	76	7	24
542	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	Also once he gets it out he of course chews on it.	76	8	12
543	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	He just got his first tooth and I noticed that with that tooth he has scraped off the pink paint from the circles and the green paint from the beak.	76	9	30
544	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	Too bad but it's bye bye birdie now.FOLLOW UP: As I expected my first one grew into sitting on the chair around 18 months.	76	10	22
545	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	"From 18 months to 3 years it was ""his"" chair to watch cartoon, read books and lounge."	76	11	15
546	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	He is 4 now and still occasionally sits in it although he likes the couch better now.	76	12	16
547	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	The chair has moved to his 1 year old little brother who likes to climb it.	76	13	15
548	B000JNP0F8	A1SFW87FUNFZGB	Baby	8	The arms and toys were lost/thrown out a long time ago and I don't bother to put in new batteries since the kids don't like the vibration but the chair itself is holding up just great.	76	14	35
549	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	My big boy about had the wire frame of his bouncy seat bent all the way back at 6 weeks but was still far too young for more upright chairs.	77	1	29
550	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	I was so happy when I found this.	77	2	8
551	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	He just loves sitting in it and looking up at us and we have a great place to put him down when we need to again.	77	3	26
552	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	I also like all the positions I can put him in with it, I know it will continue to be a good piece of baby furniture for us into the future.I really like the toy bar on this too.	77	4	38
553	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	The big eyes on the lizard and fly really attract him and he loves to bat at them.	77	5	18
554	B000JNP0F8	A1Z1R63ENLD129	Baby	8	And I like that the toy bar swings out of the way rather than me having to take it completely off and put it back on all the time, it makes my life a lot easier.	77	6	36
555	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	No kidding, my baby absolutely loves this rocker/chair.	78	1	7
556	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	because she sleeps very comfortable in it.	78	3	7
557	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	She is currently 2 months old and doesn't like to sleep flat on her back on her bassinet.	78	4	17
558	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	She has been sleeping on this chair since she was 3 weeks old!!!	78	5	12
559	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	I love the fact that it's portable.	78	6	7
560	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	We take it downstairs during the day and into our bedroom at night!!!!	78	7	13
561	B000JNP0F8	A2KTFTRTY0ONWF	Baby	8	I also love the colors, they are bright and fun!!	78	8	10
562	B000JNP0F8	AACEE1OZZ7H2B	Baby	8	"This is one of those ""must have"" baby products."	79	1	9
563	B000JNP0F8	AACEE1OZZ7H2B	Baby	8	It's so comfortable for my 5 month old.	79	2	7
564	B000JNP0F8	AACEE1OZZ7H2B	Baby	8	I have been using it since she was 2 months old.	79	3	10
565	B000JNP0F8	AACEE1OZZ7H2B	Baby	8	The recline is perfect and baby stays happy for long time and even falls asleep in it.	79	4	17
566	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	We had the older version of the infant-to-toddler rocker for my firstborn, and we bought the new one for the second.	80	1	20
567	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	I prefer the older version.	80	2	5
568	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	It was of sturdier construction, metal bars instead of plastic.	80	3	10
569	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	It also sat further back so that my baby was kind of kicked back and nestled in.	80	4	17
570	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	Sure, it only had two settings, either stationary with the bar or rocking, but all the variety of the new one is unnecesary, all these different pieces for each side, four mini-kickstands under each leg, all of which seem to magically move whenever I move the chair anywhere.	80	5	47
571	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The plastic parts are supposed to snap into place, but they also snap out much too easily.	80	6	17
572	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The old chair ... not as many adjustments, just the kickstand-like bar, and it stayed put.	80	7	14
573	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The angle of the new one is awkward.	80	8	8
574	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	My son is now nearly five months old, trying to sit up but not yet there, so he keeps pitching forward.	80	9	21
575	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The angle of the chair almost propels him, so he'll fold forward.	80	10	12
576	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The old chair kept him back more.	80	11	7
577	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	It was also impossible for him to slide out the old chair.	80	12	12
578	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	In the new one, he kicks a lot, so he winds up shimmying down to the edge.	80	13	17
579	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	The only big improvement with the new chair is a swiveling toy arm instead of the annoying toy bar that had to be popped in and out constantly.I don't hate the new chair, though it might sound like it here.	80	14	39
580	B000JNP0F8	A1O0JRU7IYBV6D	Baby	8	I just have the old one for comparison and prefer the less-is-more approach.	80	15	12
595	B000VKCGTM	A21R8JYHVCJOV5	Baby	17	need i say more?	84	1	4
596	B000VKCGTM	A21R8JYHVCJOV5	Baby	17	It was 1/3 of the price of the one at Buy Buy Baby.	84	2	12
597	B000VKCGTM	A21R8JYHVCJOV5	Baby	17	I love it.	84	3	3
598	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	We purchased this changing pad after doing some research on our own.	85	1	12
599	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	We love the three-sided contoured edges, and the size fit our delta changing table with no problems.	85	2	16
600	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	The straps are a big plus also, though our table also has straps, so we will probably end up using those.	85	3	21
601	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	I also purchased aBasic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Sage, and this cover fits just fine.	85	4	17
602	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	We were glad to see that a regular cover would fit this pad.	85	5	13
603	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	The pad is soft and comfortable, and had no smell when we removed it from the packaging.	85	6	17
604	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	We are going to purchase a second one for use downstairs.	85	7	11
605	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	I definitely recommend this product.ps.	85	8	4
606	B000VKCGTM	A3DZ8NR92O1H48	Baby	17	shipped quickly too!	85	9	3
607	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	I ordered this based on these reviews here and because it was $7 less than Babies R Us for a similar eco friendly changing pad.	86	1	24
608	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	This pad didn't have the same paper insert listing all of the organic/eco friendly assets that the changing pad has or the same print on the pad as the Babies R Us pad did, but this pad didn't smell like plastic when it came out of the package so I didn't have a problem using it for my daughter.	86	2	58
609	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	I am not an everything must be organic type of mom, but I just wanted a pad that was well made, and didn't reek like chemicals.	86	3	26
610	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	It seems to be very well made, and worst case scenario if something happens to it within the first year of ownership it's guaranteed for one year!	86	4	27
611	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	Another plus was that is Made in the USA.	86	5	9
612	B000VKCGTM	A16CL5SCB1XFCU	Baby	17	If you want all of the eco friendly labels and a little bit cuter sheep print then go to BRUS and buy their organic Serta changing pad, but if it's not a huge deal then just save a $ and get this one instead.	86	6	43
613	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	I have one of these which I have used now for 4 years between my two kids.	87	1	16
614	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	I love it so much that I bought one for my sister for her new baby.	87	2	16
615	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	The contour design makes it so that young infants have a much harder time rolling off the changing table pad, or even rolling over while trying to change them.	87	3	29
616	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	The vinyl surface is great for cleaning up leaking diapers which soak through whatever covers you decide to purchase.	87	4	19
617	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	On that note I have had great success using the covers by munchkin which have been cheaper from Target on these pads.	87	5	22
618	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	Over time the vinyl on my pad has torn and is looking very poor however we took the pad with us on a move between states and it was often forced into a section of the car which required it to be folded.	87	6	43
619	B000VKCGTM	A2RYJOZZ0CIZ7Y	Baby	17	Had we not abused it I'm sure the vinyl would have lasted longer.	87	7	13
620	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	I've used a friend's Babies R Us generic changing pad for the last two years - and then she got pregnant and needed it back - so I bought two of the Nightstar (one for each of my kids' rooms).	88	1	38
621	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	Don't get me wrong, the Nightsar is nice and works well.	88	2	11
622	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	My issue with it is that the bottom isn't slip resistant like my former one.	88	3	15
623	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	This means I'm constantly adjusting it and putting it back into place.	88	4	12
624	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	I also have to watch my daughter even closer when I'm changing her because she can extend her legs and slide the changing pad cover away from the wall.	88	5	29
625	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	I will also fairly note that I do not have these secured with the screws to the dressers, and I'm sure that would help with the slipping.	88	6	27
626	B000VKCGTM	ATTYNWUZBFDZS	Baby	17	I would prefer to have one that is slip-resistant and not have to screw unnecessary holes in our furniture!	88	7	18
687	B000YDH4HA	A5P6SLHC5PPBV	Baby	5	I bought this and another album for my grandchildren.	101	1	9
688	B000YDH4HA	A5P6SLHC5PPBV	Baby	5	This was the most effective for pictures of baby, for baby.	101	2	11
689	B000YDH4HA	A5P6SLHC5PPBV	Baby	5	It looks great with close-ups of baby faces.	101	3	7
690	B000YDH4HA	A5P6SLHC5PPBV	Baby	5	Very appealing.	101	4	2
691	B000YDH4HA	A5P6SLHC5PPBV	Baby	5	simple to assemble, just insert photos.	101	5	6
692	B000YDH4HA	A3752DDGZ3COTF	Baby	5	My 5 month old daughter and I really enjoy this little photo album.	102	1	12
693	B000YDH4HA	A3752DDGZ3COTF	Baby	5	We can go through the pages and talk about the pictures I put in while she chews on the book.	102	2	20
694	B000YDH4HA	A3752DDGZ3COTF	Baby	5	The pages are easy for her to turn and the book is nice and soft.	102	3	15
695	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	There's nothing babies like more than pictures of babies!	103	1	9
696	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	I gave this to a 9 month old family member with pictures of other babies in the family in it.	103	2	19
697	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	She loves to look at it & giggle.It is very well made.	103	3	10
698	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	I wasn't sure if the photos would be protected, so I printed my own photos out on photo paper but there was no need.	103	4	24
699	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	It is very well constructed & your photos are protected.The teething part is just genius!	103	5	13
700	B000YDH4HA	AQZ4PHIEEV5N5	Baby	5	Obviously, a mother created this darling book.	103	6	7
701	B000YDH4HA	A317DRRIFNN7QG	Baby	5	This cute photo album is nice and squishy for baby's fingers.	104	1	11
702	B000YDH4HA	A317DRRIFNN7QG	Baby	5	I only wish it had more spaces for photos.	104	2	9
703	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	My 21 month old son has had this album since he was seven months old, has played with it daily and it has survived in excellent condition.	105	1	26
704	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	He chews on it, throws it, and sleeps with it; the photos are very well protected.	105	2	16
705	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	The thing I liked best about this album was watching my son progress from pointing out the cute animals to learing the sounds they make as well as thier colors, and then to recognizing the people in the photographs.	105	3	39
706	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	This has become my son's comfort object.	105	4	7
707	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	He sleeps with it, takes it to daycare, and had to have it during a short stay in the hospital.	105	5	20
708	B000YDH4HA	A1OIOWC69R2KG5	Baby	5	It is easy to clean and for that, I am very pleased.	105	6	12
709	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	Please do not waste your money on this item!	106	1	9
710	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	It's horrible!	106	2	2
711	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	It does not work at all!	106	3	6
712	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	And the battery is a special C battery that is $6!	106	4	10
713	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	I have changed the battery twice and the thermometer does not work.	106	5	12
714	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	What a waste of money!	106	6	5
715	B001UFBVA2	A2R5612DBI4Y39	Baby	10	"It should be pulled from the shelves and sent back to the manufacturer with a ""shame on you"" message!"	106	7	19
716	B001UFBVA2	A15F75YXETI2BG	Baby	10	My thermometer is still relatively new so I'll update if I experience the same issues as some of the other reviews but I had to do a rectal temp on my newborn and it was very easy to use and I liked the safety feature of the shape of the rectal so it can't be put too far in!	107	1	59
717	B001UFBVA2	A15F75YXETI2BG	Baby	10	The temperature took very quickly and was accurate as well.	107	2	10
718	B001UFBVA2	A15F75YXETI2BG	Baby	10	I like the fact that I get three different tips in the package and that they are inter-changable.	107	3	17
719	B001UFBVA2	A15F75YXETI2BG	Baby	10	I'm really happy with it so far!	107	4	7
720	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	We ordered this mostly for our coming baby.	108	1	8
721	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	We have had the opportunity to test it out this week while my wife, daughter, and I have been sick.	108	2	20
722	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	The oral tip seems to work fine, I even think it's cool that a red light goes off when you do have a fever.	108	3	24
723	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	For my daughter, I used the under arm tip.	108	4	9
724	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	It read 95.4, I could tell by felling her this had to be very inaccurate.	108	5	14
725	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	So, I took it orally and her temp was 101.2.	108	6	9
726	B001UFBVA2	AT4TEQ216VX3K	Baby	10	On my four year old, using a different tip isn't a big deal, however if I had used this on an infant it would be a different story.	108	7	28
727	B001UFBVA2	A321YPWODPT92	Baby	10	I like that you can exchange the tips, and it comes with a handy fever reference guide.	109	1	17
728	B001UFBVA2	A321YPWODPT92	Baby	10	The thermometer claims to take quick temp.	109	2	7
729	B001UFBVA2	A321YPWODPT92	Baby	10	Worked perfect first time used.	109	3	5
730	B001UFBVA2	A321YPWODPT92	Baby	10	After one use, it takes longer than the cheap therm got from the hospital.	109	4	14
731	B001UFBVA2	A321YPWODPT92	Baby	10	So disappointed!	109	5	2
732	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	We received this packet as a baby shower gift.	110	1	9
733	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	Battery was dead before first use.	110	2	6
734	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	Kinda sucky when it's the middle of the night and your baby is screaming and your brand new thermometer is complete junk.	110	3	22
735	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	Glad we didn't waste any money on it, but it was definitely emotionally stressful because there was something wrong with our baby and we didn't know what.	110	4	27
736	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	Don't put yourself through that stress.	110	5	6
737	B001UFBVA2	A14TNHAFHTM5AR	Baby	10	Get a reliable one.	110	6	4
769	B002A9JCY4	A3BC4K4XGINMB7	Baby	32	My son loved loved this at 12 months.	116	1	7
770	B002A9JCY4	A3BC4K4XGINMB7	Baby	32	He is 16.5 months and isn't quite so interested in it anymore, but I'd recommend it to someone else.	116	2	18
771	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	Battery case must be removed with tiny screwdrviver, lots of patience, and the aide of gravity.	117	1	16
772	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	hold the toy right side up and undo the screws using the screwdriver upsidedown.	117	2	14
773	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	Add 3 AAA batteries!	117	3	3
774	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	It looks like you only need two batteries.	117	4	8
775	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	Very akward toy.	117	5	3
776	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	The batteries won't fall out as it might seem they would.	117	6	11
777	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	6 has a fountain children adore.	117	7	5
778	B002A9JCY4	ASY4CQCZ9Q2QJ	Baby	32	More money yes but so worth it, especially in comparison.	117	8	10
779	B002A9JCY4	A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S	Baby	32	Everything everyone else has posted is true.	118	1	7
780	B002A9JCY4	A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S	Baby	32	Would have been super sweet if it had lasted.... our boy loved it!!!	118	2	13
781	B002A9JCY4	A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S	Baby	32	I read the reviews after I had purchased it, so I kept the original packaging and sales slip; and luckily Target gave us our money back.	118	3	26
782	B002A9JCY4	A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S	Baby	32	Sad, sad, sad.	118	4	3
783	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	My son tried this toy out in the bath this morning, and he loved it!	119	1	15
784	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	He laughed the whole time.	119	2	5
785	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	I on the other hand didn't have as much fun.	119	3	10
786	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	The battery compartment is really hard to open.	119	4	8
787	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	It took me almost 20 minutes to pry it open after the screws were all the way out.	119	5	17
788	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	That's the only thing I didn't like about the product.	119	6	10
789	B002A9JCY4	A2FRR62Z5UZHZW	Baby	32	The toy itself though is great so far.	119	7	8
790	B002A9JCY4	A2IVT1KJJZJAYZ	Baby	32	it's wonderful toy for my kid to play when he bath.	120	1	11
791	B002A9JCY4	A2IVT1KJJZJAYZ	Baby	32	It's real good toy but after 3 month it's stop working.	120	2	10
964	B002WZ2RE8	A2686M84Z3XD29	Baby	15	This product is a great idea.	148	1	6
965	B002WZ2RE8	A2686M84Z3XD29	Baby	15	It seems like it is well constructed and would be long lasting but my son hardly gives it any attention.	148	2	20
966	B002WZ2RE8	A2686M84Z3XD29	Baby	15	He prefers to suck/chew on his fingers.	148	3	6
967	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	18 mo old with molars coming in.	149	1	6
968	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	Thought I'd give this a whirl.	149	2	6
969	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	He has no interest.	149	3	4
970	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	The material used also picks up lint and cat hair super easily.	149	4	12
971	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	Was annoying to constantly rinse.	149	5	5
972	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	It also didn't get cold in fridge.	149	6	7
973	B002WZ2RE8	A2KXH9ZYVKC6FO	Baby	15	Not a good teether if that's what you're looking for.	149	7	10
974	B002WZ2RE8	AHWUUKR4XCQFX	Baby	15	Great for the back teeth teething!	150	1	6
975	B002WZ2RE8	AHWUUKR4XCQFX	Baby	15	I hooked a pacifier clip to this so baby always has it.	150	2	12
976	B002WZ2RE8	AHWUUKR4XCQFX	Baby	15	Great chew toy!	150	3	3
977	B002WZ2RE8	A29W85T2Q6AYCP	Baby	15	Our little guy loves this teether.	151	1	6
978	B002WZ2RE8	A29W85T2Q6AYCP	Baby	15	He has been able to hold onto it since about five months and has been happily gnawing away at it ever since.	151	2	22
979	B002WZ2RE8	A29W85T2Q6AYCP	Baby	15	Super easy to wash, no strange plasticy odor, soft enough to chew but firm enough to be helpful.	151	3	18
980	B002WZ2RE8	A1XEM42SBXFSIF	Baby	15	So far this is kiddo's favorite chewy.	152	1	7
981	B002WZ2RE8	A1XEM42SBXFSIF	Baby	15	We just got it today so I'll come back and update.	152	2	11
982	B002WZ2RE8	A1XEM42SBXFSIF	Baby	15	But kiddo gave up blankey for the chewy and hasn't looked back!	152	3	12
1020	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	This diaper bag is everything that I wanted.	163	1	8
1021	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	It has the messenger strap, AND the tote straps, which is a heaven sent.	163	2	14
1022	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	These features are hard to find in the diaper bag world.	163	3	11
1023	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	The earth leather feels great.	163	4	5
1024	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	The inside has plenty of pockets.	163	5	6
1025	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	You can find great videos that really showcase and explore this bag inside and out on the little dudes and divas website.	163	6	22
1026	B003KGANTO	A30I0WCOPXCMPC	Baby	8	You've got to get this bag.	163	7	6
1027	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	This was my first JJB purchase and now I am totally obsessed with this brand.	164	1	15
1028	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I am ready to buy all their products.The first time I used this bag was for a three day trip away with no kids.	164	2	23
1029	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	It held my ipad, make-up, toiletries, sun glasses, large wallet and a whole bunch of other goodies.	164	3	16
1030	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I was truly astonished by how much fits in this bag.For every day use, I use the separator as the dividing line of kids vs. my stuff.	164	4	25
1031	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I am a pretty messy bag stuffer, but this bag has helped me clean up.	164	5	15
1032	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I have two boys 4.5yo and 16months.Here is a list of everything currently in my bag:Coach wristlet stuffed with all my cards, change, cash, lip gloss, receipts.4 - size 3 diapersWipes hard caseTissue packPair of cotton pants for my 16month son2 juice boxesBottle of water2 baby fruit veg packets3 other kid snack thingsPaperworkiPhone in front pocket.	164	6	48
1033	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	That is the only thing I keep there.Tampons and a padBatman figurinePros:Front cell pocket.	164	7	14
1034	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I can easily grab my phone without digging around thru the whole purse.	164	8	13
1035	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	Seriously every purse should have this.Key fob - I don't use this every time I am out, but I usually lose my keys in my purse and this is a fantastic idea.The bazillion pockets - JJB helps disorganized moms stay organized or feeds the craziness of the OCDs.Roominess - I cannot believe how much I can get shoved in here if needed.Styling - I love love love the steel gray color and lavender lining.	164	9	67
1036	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	the shape is really cute too.Cons:This bag might not be for the over packer or people who need to pack a lot of stuff.	164	10	24
1037	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I do not see this working for a newborn baby bag, but is wonderful come like 1 yrs old.This bag is used for everyday run around, birthday parties, shopping, but not for extended time where I would need to bring 2 pairs of clothes for my boys, blankets or toys.	164	11	47
1038	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	For that I need another bag and am probably going to purchase the JJB be prepared or BFF.Seriously buy this bag!	164	12	20
1039	B003KGANTO	A14Z8TV56K9182	Baby	8	I have even convinced a friend with no kiddies to purchase this bag.	164	13	13
1040	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	Okay, I don't actually have a touring tote to compare but I did my research and the Behave has so many extra features.	165	1	23
1041	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	I mostly like the earth leather look as opposed to the PPB prints which are pretty but don't fit in with an everyday wardrobe.	165	2	24
1042	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	Even the hobobe has nothing on this bag.	165	3	8
1043	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	Surprisingly, nearly everything that was in my jujube BFF bag fits in this one too!	165	4	15
1044	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	And we cloth diaper!	165	5	4
1045	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	Great purchase, I just wish it came with more accessories like a changing pad.	165	6	14
1046	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	Also, yes this bag is expensive, it's not real leather so the price can seem kind of out there.	165	7	19
1047	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	What you're really paying for are the patented jujube features.	165	8	10
1048	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	It's machine washable,  has insulated bottle pockets, anti microbial light colored lining, key fob, and oodles of organizational pockets.	165	9	19
1049	B003KGANTO	A2F7N087JYGHV9	Baby	8	I wish it was less expensive but all in all, as long as it holds up over time I'm okay with having shelled out $$$.	165	10	24
1050	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I never ever thought I could 'pull off' this bag.	166	1	9
1051	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	let me explain.	166	2	3
1052	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I am a former backpack girl.	166	3	6
1053	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I own and love the ju ju be Be Right Back 2.0.	166	4	11
1054	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I love to be hands free.	166	5	6
1055	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I have three boys under age 4, yes, three!	166	6	8
1056	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	We cloth diaper.	166	7	3
1057	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	My two older boys love their sippy cups.	166	8	8
1058	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I need to carry a lot of stuff with me to feel prepared.	166	9	13
1059	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I fell in love with the Ju Ju Be earth leather when I ordered a Be Quick in earth leather.	166	10	20
1060	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Yes, you can tell its not real leather, but its still fabulous.	166	11	12
1061	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	It has a soft, glossy, quality feel.	166	12	7
1062	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	It has an expensive look.	166	13	5
1063	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	It's machine washable!	166	14	3
1064	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I love it.	166	15	3
1065	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	As our lives get busier and busier I found myself craving a bag that I could reach into instantly but also be hands free.	166	16	24
1066	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	So I started looking at messenger-style bags.	166	17	6
1067	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I was about to settle for the Ju Ju be Hobobe which has great reviews, but I was sad it did not come in earth leather.	166	18	26
1068	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Finally, I took a closer look at the BeHave and decided that I would at least give it a try.	166	19	20
1069	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	(Amazon is currently offering free returns for select handbags...yeay!	166	20	10
1070	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	)I never thought all my stuff would fit, but I came to terms with downsizing.	166	21	15
1071	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Well.. it came..	166	22	3
1072	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I packed it up.. and I am shocked!	166	23	8
1073	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	It has an amazing capacity!	166	24	5
1074	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	It has become my new favorite bag by a landslide.	166	25	10
1075	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I own the brown/teal version and I will mention that it might have been better to purchase the brown/zany zinnias instead of the teal.	166	26	22
1076	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I find the teal a little bit dark and, owning other Ju Ju Be products, I know that I prefer having the lighter colors on the inside.	166	27	27
1077	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	However, the price of the brown/teal version was only $134, so I did save a bit of money by ordering the teal version.	166	28	21
1078	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Back to my loves - BOTH kids sippies fit in the side (yes, 1 of the sippy cups is a tight squeeze, being put in the sunglass holder pocket, but it fits!)	166	29	30
1079	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	pockets,  & I even have space to cram in a bottle of water for myself in the main pocket!	166	30	18
1080	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	All of my stuff fits, and the best part is that it looks super stylish and svelte!	166	31	17
1081	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I, of course, wear it messenger style, but I use the shorter tote straps occasionally as well.	166	32	17
1082	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I enjoy being able to reach in (I keep it unzipped) and grab what I need instantly.	166	33	17
1083	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I am impressed with how lightweight it is.	166	34	8
1084	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Overall, this is an amazing bag.	166	35	6
1085	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	Yes, like most Ju Ju Be products, the price is a bit high.	166	36	13
1086	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	But, consider that you can also use it for a purse when the little ones are grown up.	166	37	18
1087	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	I just love it and think if you are even considering it, you should just take the plunge and get the BeHave.	166	38	22
1088	B003KGANTO	A23A7BOMCTLE4O	Baby	8	You will LOVE it!	166	39	4

1090	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	My husband would consider me to be the Goldilocks of diaper bags.	167	1	12
1091	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I started with a gorgeous Petunia Pickle Bottom bag, but it was too narrow and deep to find anything, or to get into it while carrying it and a baby.	167	2	30
1092	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I moved on to a giant Target purse, but that one didn't have enough pockets.	167	3	15
1093	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	Next, a Fleurville Re-Run bag that was difficult to close and uncomfortable to carry as a cross-body bag (a necessity for an Ergo-loving mama such as myself).	167	4	24
1094	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	From there I moved on to a pretty blue flowered Boden diaper bag that was huge and roomy and I loved it, except that it was too huge and roomy and it was like carrying around a duffel bag all the time.	167	5	42
1095	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	Then I stumbled upon the Jujube Behave bag while shopping at a local baby superstore.	167	6	15
1096	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I was carrying my 6 month old in the Ergo, so I decided to sling the Behave across my body and see how it felt.	167	7	24
1097	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	It was surprisingly comfy and it didn't even look like a diaper bag!	167	8	13
1098	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	It looked like a fancy leather purse, only it wasn't real leather.	167	9	12
1099	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I fell instantly in love, but could not bring myself to fork over the $160.	167	10	14
1100	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	So, I added it to my wish list and I received it for Christmas.	167	11	14
1101	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I cannot rave enough about this diaper bag.	167	12	9
1102	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I am not a heavy packer, so this works very well for me and I still have space left over.	167	13	20
1103	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I have two children, but most of what goes into this bag are my usual purse contents (wallet, checkbook [Why?	167	14	20
1104	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	I don't know...], notepad, cell phone, keys, small toiletry bag of assorted lip glosses and lipsticks, sunglasses, tissues) and items for my baby (diapers, wipes, change of clothes, spoon, bib, diaper cream, Mum-mums).	167	15	32
1105	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	Now, I do find that when I put a changing pad inside the purse, it gets a bit too bulky.	167	16	20
1106	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	If you use those disposable travel ones, I'm sure it would fit fine.	167	17	13
1107	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	Again, this is my second child, so I either leave a changing pad in the car, or I cover the public changing station with a bunch of paper towels and that works just fine.Honestly, this is the first diaper bag that I haven't tired of after a few days of use.	167	18	50
1108	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	Plus, I can use it the few rare times when I'm out and about by myself and it doesn't even look like I'm carrying a diaper bag.	167	19	27
1109	B003KGANTO	A28NA275A0O34H	Baby	8	"This one is definitely ""just right."""	167	20	6
1152	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	We hummed and hawed about a changing table for the 9 months of pregnancy until a month after birth.	171	1	18
1153	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	We wanted something that was more than just a table, that would be useful past infancy, and that didn't cost an arm and a leg.	171	2	25
1154	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	We were hesitant to buy something this large online but we are so thankful that we did.	171	3	17
1155	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	It is manufactured wood.	171	4	4
1156	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	so the paint does scratch easily, there are a lot of pieces, and it is heavy, but we love it!	171	5	20
1157	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	It feels so solid once put together and is so easy to keep stuff at hand and organized.	171	6	18
1158	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	Diaper changes are a breeze and it is babies FAVORITE place to be.	171	7	13
1159	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	She smiles and talks anytime she's on the table!	171	8	9
1160	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	The drawers provide enough space for all of our cloth diapers and all of babies clothes.	171	9	16
1161	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	Once she's older it will be a perfect small dresser for her bedroom.	171	10	13
1162	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	If you want a solid, real wood piece of furniture you are going to pay a lot more than this.	171	11	20
1163	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	If you want a functional, easy to use, convenient piece at a reasonable price this is it!	171	12	17
1164	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	I also want to mention the customer service of this company is the best we've ever experienced!	171	13	17
1165	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	there was a small nick in one of the panels and we called them and they sent us a completely new piece free of charge and it was delivered within the week.	171	14	32
1166	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	The representative was super nice as well.	171	15	7
1167	B004H69GSU	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	5	And just an FYI sometimes they use scrap wood as packaging to prevent damage so if you have extra wood don't think that you missed a step, its just extras :-)	171	16	30
1168	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	The dresser looks nice, but couldn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The remainder of the furniture we bought for our baby's room is cherry - this color is darker than cherry (more brown), the only parts that match hardwood cherry stain are the legs, because they are wood.2) The drawer knobs were ridiculously hard to screw in.	172	1	56
1169	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	In fact we eventually drilled them in with an electric drill because the screws would not screw into the knobs.3) It is mildly unsteady.	172	2	23
1170	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	Because the back is not wood, just heavy-duty cardboard (I think), the dresser has a little bit of wobble to it.	172	3	20
1171	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	Not a major problem, but does exist.Overall, we like it.	172	4	9
1172	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	The drawers are a nice size.	172	5	6
1173	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	The vertical drawer for diapers etc.	172	6	6
1174	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	is a great addition and very good storage.	172	7	8
1175	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	The top changing station is great, especially with the divider.	172	8	10
1176	B004H69GSU	A37WWFXCY2H4ZV	Baby	5	It comes with a marker for marking scratches on the wood, which we've already had to use several times even before using it, but it does an adequate job of covering things up.	172	9	33
1177	B004H69GSU	A3P7D1V99ZZ3HG	Baby	5	My husband built it so I can't speak for the assembly but it is a great nursery addition.	173	1	18
1178	B004H69GSU	A3P7D1V99ZZ3HG	Baby	5	I love that it doubles as a dresser and you can remove the top frame for when you don't need the changing part anymore.	173	2	24
1179	B004H69GSU	A3P7D1V99ZZ3HG	Baby	5	The pull out is perfect for diaper storage and holds a large box of diapers plus more (approx 110+).	173	3	18
1180	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	You definitely get what you pay for here.	174	1	8
1181	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	The quality is so cheap.	174	2	5
1182	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	I have only been using it for 4 months and I already see wear on the edges.	174	3	16
1183	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	It did come with a marker for that, I haven't used it though.	174	4	13
1184	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	Doubt it will cover up.	174	5	5
1185	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	Plus assembling it is labor intensive!	174	6	6
1186	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	The only thing I like, and the only reason why I purchased this, is because of the space it has... Large dressers combined with a diaper changer and room to keep things like diapers and wipes within reach to avoid turning around while my son is on the changer.	174	7	49
1187	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	It fits perfectly in my little nursery.	174	8	7
1188	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	If you have a tight budget, I would definitely get it.	174	9	11
1189	B004H69GSU	ATZ0CY2Y8MAF6	Baby	5	It's worth it for the price.	174	10	6
1190	B004H69GSU	A1PUNPU4C4ROTF	Baby	5	it very nice and a little longer than just a regular size changing table.good price,good material,we are satisfied with this purchase and I would buy it again.	175	1	28
1191	B005CX0208	A71K1706C6EDY	Baby	21	Great thing to help us out to one year and three months, until the son took a pacifier.	176	1	18
1192	B005CX0208	A71K1706C6EDY	Baby	21	I really was happy.	176	2	4
1193	B005CX0208	A71K1706C6EDY	Baby	21	Worth its price.	176	3	3
1194	B005CX0208	A71K1706C6EDY	Baby	21	colors are great, well washed	176	4	5
1195	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	I bought this to go on our Gumdrops pacifier.	177	1	9
1196	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	I just got it out and started using it today, but so far I love it!The metal clip is strong, reinforced with some sort of rubber-like material inside the clip to prevent slipping.	177	2	33
1197	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	The string/loop that attaches to the binky seems extremely sturdy.	177	3	9
1198	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	The clip looks like it'll hold well enough for its' purpose.	177	4	11
1199	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	I mean, I wouldn't use it to go mountain climbing, but it should be just great at keeping the binky from hitting the floor.	177	5	24
1200	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	Plus, I LOVE the fun colors the BooginHead clips come in!	177	6	11
1201	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	Purchase the Black Swirl and Pink Polka dots and love both prints.So, two thumbs up from me on this item.	177	7	19
1202	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	If I get a few months down the road and the product is a bust, I'll update my review.	177	8	19
1203	B005CX0208	A36Z9FG2A90F60	Baby	21	I do NOT anticipate any issues though, and look forward to getting a lot use out of it!	177	9	18
1204	B005CX0208	A1OK7EQP0GTP8U	Baby	21	I ordered this paciclip before our little one was even born.	178	1	11
1205	B005CX0208	A1OK7EQP0GTP8U	Baby	21	Little did we know that she would only want to use the pacifiers given by the hospital.	178	2	17
1206	B005CX0208	A1OK7EQP0GTP8U	Baby	21	They have a small whole and it can be tricky to find a paciclip that fits it.	178	3	17
1207	B005CX0208	A1OK7EQP0GTP8U	Baby	21	Well, this one works perfectly and is stylish too!	178	4	9
1208	B005CX0208	A1OK7EQP0GTP8U	Baby	21	Love it!	178	5	2
1209	B005CX0208	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	21	When the babe was a few weeks old we took a trip to Portland for the day and 3 dirty pacies later we knew we needed a solution.	179	1	27
1210	B005CX0208	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	21	This pacigrip is great because it is not made of cheap plastics that easily break like others.	179	2	17
1211	B005CX0208	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	21	It has a strong grip that never falls offs, saving those precious pacies from the nasty floor.	179	3	17
1212	B005CX0208	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	21	Now we can travel with just one pacifier!	179	4	8
1213	B005CX0208	A3I57SEF7AJRLM	Baby	21	And the print on this one is super cute!	179	5	9
1214	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	I got the booginhead pacigrips because they attach easily to the soothie pacifiers which is the only one my child would take.	180	1	22
1215	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	The clasp on the other end grips easily, It rarely detaches on its own unless you really yank on it.	180	2	20
1216	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	Its better than some of the other plastic grips that break, or fall off easily.	180	3	15
1217	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	My child enjoys the feeling of the ribbon and rubs it while she has her pacifier, Its comforting to her.	180	4	20
1218	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	I got one booginhead at a yardsale and three weeks after my daughter arrived I ordered a few more!	180	5	19
1219	B005CX0208	A25L2O2B96L7ON	Baby	21	I love them!	180	6	3
