0	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Loopy Landscapes is the second expansion pack for the original Roller Coaster Tycoon.For the price, you get quite a few extra goodies.	1	1	21
1	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Loopy Landscapes includes 30 new scenarios, 3 `real' pre-built-parks, new themes, new coaster designs, new shops/stalls, music and coloring options, plus a few new rides.	1	2	21
2	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	It should be said upfront that this expansion also includes RCT's 1st expansion: Corkscrew Follies, so you don't need to purchase it as a separate item.The scenarios, like the original and first expansion get progressively harder, and when you load it for the first time, only 5 of the scenarios are unlocked.	1	3	49
3	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	You must complete a scenario here in order to unlock others.	1	4	11
4	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	However, I think this is where Loopy Landscapes shines in game play: The new scenarios are much more dynamic, creative, and challenging than previous ones.	1	5	25
5	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Here, instead of the normal `Have 1,200 guests by the end of year 3', or `Have a Park Value of $XX,XXX' by the end of year 3', you'll find you have to create certain excitement levels on half built coasters, or create X coasters of Y type.	1	6	45
6	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	My favorite so far is `Arid Heights' where you are free from any financial burdens....just a big sandbox mode in which to create a park that will attract 2000 guests.	1	7	30
7	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	I like it because you are not restricted to time or money and can make a beautiful park.Also Loopy Landscapes groups the scenarios by tabs.	1	8	24
8	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	There is one tab each for the original game, Corkscrew Follies, Loopy Landscapes, Extra's, and Real Parks.	1	9	17
9	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Very cool to be able to switch between these.	1	10	9
10	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Also the `Real Parks' are just plain beautiful to look at and watch.	1	11	13
11	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Sure you can change them, but I like to study them for tips and hints on what you can bring into one of the other scenarios you are working on.There are a few new coasters and a few new rides including `Jet Skis' and `Enterprise', but there are many new shops/stalls to choose from.	1	12	52
12	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	The new coloring options have been expanded; you have more control over how a ride is now painted.	1	13	18
13	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	There are many new tiles for roofing and ground cover, including snow, swamp, Martian, wood, etc.	1	14	16
14	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Also, there are new supports for different walkways and queue lines.	1	15	11
15	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	The music scores for rides have been expanded as well; you must check out the `Oriental Style'....very beautiful.	1	16	19
16	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	For a new expansion, I would have liked to see a few more new thrill rides.Lastly is the new themes themselves.	1	17	20
17	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	There is now Arctic, Medieval, Spooky, Space, and more.	1	18	9
18	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	This adds so much creativity, but the biggest let down is that some of the older themes could have been expanded, but were not.	1	19	24
19	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Like Old West should have had maybe a saloon, more cacti, horse tie-ups, mine cars, etc.	1	20	15
20	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	Or Jurassic could have had more dinosaur's, Egyptian and Greek could have been expanded too.	1	21	15
21	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	There are some themes that are begging to be created, like Pirates, or Super Hero's, or Mexican.	1	22	17
22	B00004WHW7	ADJKMC7AO7YN3	Video Games	21	However, the Oriental theme was done very nice.Overall, a worthy addition to RCT.	1	23	12
23	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	If you had the 1st RCT you'd love it but eventually the novelty wears off.	2	1	14
24	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Well if you pick up this expansion which has 2 add-on packs you'd be thrilled.	2	2	13
25	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	However if you already have &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot; you'd notice that their aren't that many new things added on.	2	3	20
26	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Still the game is worth it for diehard RCT Fans.Some new things in terms of scenary.	2	4	15
27	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	LL really has a lot of new themeing types, which is always fun.	2	5	13
28	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	The CF features that carry over are new entertainers, music choices, painting colors and section painting.	2	6	16
29	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	If you are really into the whole themeing thing then this is truly the expansion pack for you.Rides: CF gives you a lot of new gentle rides, and a few thrill rides.	2	7	31
30	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Around 10-12 new rollercoasters really add to the gameplay as they are all different, and fun.	2	8	15
31	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	One new thing you'll see alot of with LL is water rides.	2	9	12
32	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Jet skis, water coasters, raft rides etc.	2	10	7
33	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	are all brand new which is a good change.	2	11	9
34	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	In terms of ride improvements you get a lot of new rollercoaster cart types which is cool.SHOPS: There are tooooons of new shops so if you wanna make more money this is an easy way.	2	12	35
35	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	There is everything from tee-shirt and hat stalls to fried chicken and coffee shops.BAD THINGS: Some major bummers: you can no longer charge admission to your park, which is wear [i think] a lot of the money comes from.	2	13	37
36	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Also you can't research ride improvements which I guess is OK cuz you get the stuff you'd be researching then.SCENARIOS: The corkscrew follies scenarios are REALLLLY Hard.	2	14	26
37	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	At least I think so.	2	15	5
38	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	They have big goals and are all similar in that you have to have x number of people in your park by a certain time.	2	16	25
39	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	The Loopy Landscape scenarios are fun because they are different.	2	17	10
40	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	There is a huge empty park right in the beginning with unlimited money!	2	18	13
41	B00004WHW7	AWVQR7YYTYJ1L	Video Games	21	Some new ways to win include &quot;Finish building these 5 rollercoasters to have an excitement value of 6.7&quot; or &quot;earn $8000 a month with ride ticket sales.&quot;  These new ways to play are really great!So even if you already have CF this is a great expansion cuz you can get a rebate	2	19	53
42	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	This expansion to Roller Coaster Tycoon (you must already have installed a copy of that game) includes the &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot; expansion as well.	3	1	25
43	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	There are many new challenging scenarios - including many coaster &quot;finishing&quot; parks.	3	2	13
44	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	There are new park themes and themed ride entrances.	3	3	9
45	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	There are whole new shops - including the long-awaited &quot;T-Shirt Shop&quot;.	3	4	10
46	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	There are a few new rides - including the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.But the best feature of this expansion is the fact that the &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot; expansion is also included for free!	3	5	32
47	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	This is =another= 30 more scenarios, a bunch of new ride enhancements, and many customizing details.	3	6	14
48	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	If you've always wondered what it would be like to own an amusement park, you will get many hours of fun out of this expansion.If you have Roller Coaster Tycoon, (and if you don't - go get one!)	3	7	36
49	B00004WHW7	A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A	Video Games	21	and you haven't got &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot; then you'll love this great double sized addition to that game.	3	8	19
50	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	Roller Coaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes is a great game, yet it lacks a few things.	4	1	15
51	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	First, it hasn't added many new rides.	4	2	7
52	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	Also, you can't charge admission to the park in the normal scenarios, which is where most of the income comes from.	4	3	21
53	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	On the other hand, it does add tons of new shops and stalls, and it adds 30 new scenarios, most of them having unique goals, such as: &quot;Have a monthly ride income of at least $8,000.&quot; Hence the name, Loopy Landscapes has added six new exciting themes, like a Winter theme or a Creepy theme.	4	4	55
54	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	Loopy Landscapes gives three actual parks that you can control.	4	5	10
55	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	Alton Towers is one of them.	4	6	6
56	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	Overall, I really like Loopy Landscapes, though it does lack a few things.	4	7	13
57	B00004WHW7	A2J27TTY9PWFLG	Video Games	21	I would recommend this game to anyone who has some Roller Coaster Tycoon experience.	4	8	14
58	B00004WHW7	A18JOUVR7H8E9U	Video Games	21	I swear this game made time fly by like fleas... it was a ton of fun.... there is a TON of scenarios and you have to unlock em all... good luck cause it's gonna require hundreds if not thousands of hours to get them all...My Favorite Parks fyi were: Pacific Pyramids, Jolly Jungle, Glacier somethin (I forgot the full name), Funtopia, Millenium Mines, Arid Heights, Forest Frontiers, Leafy Lake,  and a couple of others that I have forgotton.My only complaint was that I had to wipe out my comp recently cause of viruses so I coundn't unlock all of em but I was pretty close :(...	5	1	106
59	B00004WHW7	A18JOUVR7H8E9U	Video Games	21	I made it to Pacifica, Sunny Swamps, and Thunder Rock then I got a virus so I had to reinstall everythin... it sucked but oh well...	5	2	26
169	B00005Q8KY	A2ZDGYRE5UHGIE	Video Games	5	When Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 was first released in 2001,it was pretty fun for the time.But extreme sports games have come much farther ever since then.With hot games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and the underappreciated Aggresive Inline pushing the extreme sports boundries so far these days,there is really no reason to buy Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2.I will have to give it some credit though:it features huge,well designed levels(athough you can sometimes get lost in them they are so big.	22	1	82
170	B00005Q8KY	A2ZDGYRE5UHGIE	Video Games	5	)and the soundtrack is actually pretty good(it features artists like Subline,Gang Starr,The Cult,Rage Against the Machine,and more).That will only get it so far though.I suggest you should skip this title and move on with your life because you aren't really missing much if you don't buy or play Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2.	22	2	56
171	B00005Q8KY	A3KZZ9JRY9FROO	Video Games	5	A good game within its own category considering its a extreme sports game.	23	1	13
172	B00005Q8KY	A3KZZ9JRY9FROO	Video Games	5	It joins the ranks of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but does not live up to THPS standards.However, the soundtrack is impressive enough to keep you somewhat entertained as you bike your way through the levels.	23	2	34
173	B00005Q8KY	A3KZZ9JRY9FROO	Video Games	5	It is a mediocre game but not of THPS quality so unless you have a passion for BMX then you should keep some distance from this game.	23	3	27
174	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	THPS is so much fun, and it has infinate replay value, so this should too, right?	24	1	16
175	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Sadly, no.	24	2	2
176	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Only 2 tricks are customizeable, but that's not the problem.	24	3	9
177	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	No one has ever heard of any of the guys, except maybe the &quot;Slim Jim&quot; mascot, but characters' names don't matter, either.	24	4	24
178	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	So what is the problem?	24	5	5
179	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Think about it, in THPS, you start out fast, you recover fast, and you never really slow down.	24	7	18
180	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	In this, you go slow until you hit a hill, take 20 minutes to get up, and once you stop--you take your sweet time speeding up again.	24	8	27
181	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	(Ever ride an actual single-speed bike?	24	9	5
182	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Hard to pedal, right?	24	10	4
183	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Espescially up hills.	24	11	3
184	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Same here, you pedal like crazy and go nowhere.	24	12	9
185	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	[But you get there fast!])	24	13	5
186	B00005Q8KY	A1TFH5Y9I9M3YN	Video Games	5	Seriously, pre-order THPS3 and steer clear of this.	24	14	6
187	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 is not as good as it should be.	25	1	12
188	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	The music is good.	25	2	4
189	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	Im a rock fan.	25	3	4
190	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	But some cheap things are, oh say, the backflip to grind.	25	4	11
191	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	No ones ever done it.	25	5	5
192	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	There not insane, stupid or crazy enough.	25	6	7
193	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	Also, there are plants in this video game that when you run over them, they crack like wood.	25	7	18
194	B00005Q8KY	A3NLIRZB0K479C	Video Games	5	Bottom line, stick to the THPS series.	25	8	7
195	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	This game is fun to play for awhile - but if your not a skater/biker it won't interest you one bit.	26	1	19
196	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	This game is almost identical to the PS2 version except the X-Box has more levels for it.	26	2	15
197	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	As with most games of this genre, Dave Mirra's has a pretty good soundtrack but is lacking number of songs.	26	3	20
198	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	I found my self up loading CD's of music so that I could listen to something other then the continually repeating seven (or some) songs from the game.	26	4	28
199	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	As far as actual game play goes, the game moves at an on/off pace, some controls are a bit frustrating to get the hang of, and the graphics are only mediocre.	26	5	30
200	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	I think the best thing in this game is the movement of the biker when bailing from hitting a car or a railing.	26	6	23
201	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	The biker resembles something close to a rag doll getting pulled on by a 3 yr old - arms and legs bend all over his body which is completely unrealistic, but funny as hell.	26	7	32
202	B00005Q8KY	A2WRYF3OQVVJDE	Video Games	5	The other good aspect is the number of different multiplayer modes you can play (everything from Highest Jump, to Horse, to wipeout).In a nut shell this game can be alot of fun but only if you have the interest and a couple other people to play it with...	26	8	48
203	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	"first off read the review titled: ""Not bad.... but could have been more"" that person has done a good job of summing up the gameplay and the overall quality of the game."	27	1	32
204	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	I would echo the fact that the game is fun for a few hours.	27	2	14
205	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	The gameplay ramps up considerably fast and I find the second 5 levels to be really challenging.	27	3	16
206	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	Only for the extremely dextrous fingers.	27	4	6
207	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	The audio and video are both very solid, and I bet fans of britney (esp young ones) will really enjoy the back stage reward features where you can unlock footage of her rehersals from her vegas show that was on mtv.	27	5	41
208	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	The slightly interactive concert footage is cool and there are a bunch of other clips of britney being goofy to unlock.	27	6	21
209	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	All this would have been better if the film quality or backstage footage was really high quality but its just not so you are left sort of wanting more.	27	7	29
210	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	The MAJOR drawback (if not for the following I would have thought the game had meritted 3 or 4 stars) is that it only contains 5 songs.	27	8	24
211	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	That is just silly britney has at least 10 singles and other popular music games make it a point to include closer to a dozen different songs.	27	9	26
212	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	I like stronger, hit me baby, oops, slave, and hhmmmm the other one escapes me, but its just not enough after a couple hours.	27	10	24
213	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	Furthermore any parent or roomate listening in will be driven crazy after an hour of the same 5 songs.One final note -- the game has a very nice 2 player mode that allows for a good deal of handicapping while still making the game fun for both players.	27	11	44
214	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	That I can appreciate.	27	12	4
215	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	In conclusion, while by no means a dud, Britney could have added another 5 songs and the game would have been a real sleeper.	27	13	23
216	B00005V3FA	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Video Games	10	As it is its probably a better rental except for die hard fans.	27	14	13
217	B00005V3FA	A5BVWSS43142	Video Games	10	i feel that dance dance revolution is better and this game only copied it.	28	1	14
218	B00005V3FA	A5BVWSS43142	Video Games	10	If you where interested in this game.	28	2	7
219	B00005V3FA	A5BVWSS43142	Video Games	10	Get Dance Dance Revolution or one of the sequals such as ddr max.I also recommend the mats for it.the mats last about a year.Pros of Dance Dance Revolution:Good exercise with matsHelps you make quick desicisions with fast songsHelps timingFunCons of Dance Dance Revolution:very very addictive but who caresmats only last a year long [yes that addictive]	28	3	55
220	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	In the video game world, it's not such a great idea to mix celebrities with software...don't ask why.	29	1	19
221	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"The 80's band, Journey, had their on video game, along with Wu Tang Clan's ""Wu Tang: Shaolin Style"" fighting game, and then there's Aerosmith's God-awful ""Revolution X"" shooing gallery game, that was so frustrating and the music was so horrible, that you wanted to stick ball-point pens in your eyes and ears!!!"	29	2	49
222	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"Flash forward to 2002, where THQ tries to compete with it's opponent Konami's ""Dance Dance Revolution"" arcade hit, by staging a celebrity dance battle."	29	3	23
223	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	And putting who as the host?	29	4	6
224	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"None other than Pop-singer super-star, Britney Spears.In THQ's ""Britney's Dance Beat"", players will get the opportunity to play a back-up dancer for Britney's upcoming tour."	29	5	21
225	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	The idea puts migrane through my head just thinking about it.	29	6	11
226	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"Many people have mixed reactions to Spears' taste in music and style...many think she'll be the next Madonna or Janet Jackson, while others think she's just a teenage girl, who pronces around in a Bra and thong with a snake and declares ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", lip-syncing to the words."	29	7	50
227	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"The propagnda states ""Live out your Fantasies, becoming a back-up dancer for Britney Spears!!!""."	29	8	13
228	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"First of all, most peoples fantasies (mostly guys) about Britney aren't about ""Dancing"" with her."	29	9	15
229	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	This is the type of video game for people that even like disapointting themselves in their own fantasies!	29	10	18
230	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	Now, I'm not saying this was a bad game.	29	11	9
231	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"Actually, it was pretty entertaining,for people that don't have ""Dance, Dance""."	29	12	12
232	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	You pick from a selecton of dancers and go through try-outs.	29	13	10
233	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	If you succeed, you become a back-up dance for her next concert.	29	14	11
234	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	But there is some competiton from other dancers.	29	15	8
235	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	In due time through out the game, you unlock secret videos and concert clips, that are at least somewhat intresting, being that you're probably out of breath from the jumping you had to do (the game is compatible with Sony's Dance pad for PSone) or thumb cramps from the constant pushing you had to exicute.	29	16	55
236	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	"You pretty much dance to every song she does, including ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", ""Oops, I did it again"", ""Stronger"" and others."	29	17	22
237	B00005V3FA	A2ZF78RQCO57FU	Video Games	10	It's a pretty average dance game, but the extra star instead of 3 stars is because I a fan of Britney, believe it or not.	29	18	24
238	B00005V3FA	A1YTQUIFXD5LG1	Video Games	10	This game is fun and simple.	30	1	6
239	B00005V3FA	A1YTQUIFXD5LG1	Video Games	10	Not much to it just some oldie britney music and a chance to dance to it.	30	2	16
240	B00005V3FA	A1YTQUIFXD5LG1	Video Games	10	You can also play w a controller.Only a handful of songs and nothing challenging.	30	3	13
241	B00005V3FA	A1YTQUIFXD5LG1	Video Games	10	Good for younger kids.	30	4	4
242	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	There is one thing I should get straight before I start.	31	1	11
243	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of Britney Spears.	31	2	13
244	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	I probably never will be.	31	3	5
245	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	But I do like rhythm/dancing games, so I gave this one a try just for fun.The gameplay for the most part is basic.	31	4	21
246	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	You try to press the correct buttons with the correct timing.	31	5	11
247	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	Mostly you are using the x, circle, square and triangle buttons, but occasionally a directional button will be thrown in, which adds to the challenge immensely.	31	6	26
248	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	You are auditioning to be one of Britney's backup dancers by dancing off against other dancers.	31	7	16
249	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	You go through ten auditions before being allowed to audition against Britney herself.	31	8	13
250	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	After each audition, you are awarded points based on your performance.	31	9	11
251	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	"These points eventually reward you with ""backstage passes"" that allow you to see video clips of Britney.The one innovative gameplay element that I like about this game is that when your competitor does well, he or she can make your moves harder."	31	10	41
252	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	Every time your opponent strings a combo of ten button presses together, it adds or changes your sequence.	31	11	18
253	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	It may change one of your buttons, it may add a directional button, it may cause one of your button presses to be moved up or back, or it may add one or two extra button presses so that you have to hit ten buttons in rapid succession.	31	12	48
254	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	Of course, by stringing together a combo of ten yourself, you do the same thing to your opponent.	31	13	18
255	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	Although this can be infuriating at times, it at least adds some challange to an otherwise simple game.I do have a few complaints about the game.	31	14	25
256	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	First, it is too short and easy.	31	15	7
257	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	You could play through the game with one dancer in a few hours easily, and through the entire game with all six dancers in a weekend.	31	16	26
258	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	Therefore, I would just recommend this as a rental.	31	17	9
259	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	"Also, there are only five songs, and if you were not sick of hearing ""Oops...I did it again"" before, you will be after playing this game."	31	18	27
260	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	My second complaint is that there should be a replay option.	31	19	11
261	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	One problem with rhythm games is that while you are playing, you really cannot afford to look at what is going on because you have to be paying close attention to the meter.	31	20	34
262	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	There should be a way to replay what you just did so you can watch all the moves that your dancer just did.If you like rhythm games, try this as a rental.	31	21	31
263	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	You just might find the gameplay very addictive.	31	22	8
264	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	If you like rhythm games and you are also a fan of Britney's, you might just find this worth you money.	31	23	21
265	B00005V3FA	A27YUZ4HZHPWUU	Video Games	10	But for serious gamers, Dance Beat really does not offer much depth.	31	24	12
294	B0002FQVEW	AD81H63G30R01	Video Games	6	If you totally love dogs and video games, this is your dream game!	37	1	13
295	B0002FQVEW	AD81H63G30R01	Video Games	6	Be a dog in the game.	37	2	6
296	B0002FQVEW	AD81H63G30R01	Video Games	6	Play as Jake.	37	3	3
297	B0002FQVEW	AD81H63G30R01	Video Games	6	Dig, play with a cute rubber ball, shake cats, chase chickens, bark all you want!, run from the dog catcher,swim and so much more!	37	4	25
298	B0002FQVEW	AD81H63G30R01	Video Games	6	Dog's life is so worth your money!	37	5	7
299	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	Jake the dog, in this wild game, is a dog who goes places, saves the day, and collect items.	38	1	19
300	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	It is a very fun game with a wide variety of places to explore, things to do, and games to play.	38	2	21
301	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	The gameplay is simple, and does have several challanges.	38	3	9
302	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	You get to do all sorts of wild things like pee on targets or chase/bite enemies.	38	4	15
303	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	This game is great for kids 10+ because Jake tends to say some odd and slightly inapropriate things.	38	5	17
304	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	But it is great for dog lovers, and animal lovers alike.	38	6	11
305	B0002FQVEW	A2I9FGQXFX4OVW	Video Games	6	Good graphics, and long lasting fun.	38	7	6
306	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	This game is classic!	39	1	4
307	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	I just bought it, and it cracks me up.	39	2	9
308	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	The humor is a little off color, hence the Teen rating, but it isn't anything worse than cartoons kids would see on Saturday mornings.The graphics and sounds are good, and somewhat realistic.	39	3	31
309	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	The game centers around Jake the dog, whom you direct to complete various tasks to collect bones.	39	4	17
310	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	The jokes will crack adults up, and kids will like the running around as different kids of dogs.The key to the game is smell-o-vision, where the view switches to first person and now smells are visible as colored clouds.	39	5	37
311	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	You need to collect different colored clouds to compete in challenges, like tug of war and peeing competitions!	39	6	18
312	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	Once you win a competition, you can then play as that breed of dog (e.g.	39	7	14
313	B0002FQVEW	A1517476XFOC7A	Video Games	6	chihuahua, mini-doberman, husky).At $20, this is s a great game for kids and adults.	39	8	12
314	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Dog's Life is amazing.	40	1	4
315	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	You can really do whatever you want as a dog.	40	2	10
316	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Chase chickens, scare the mailman, jump on cars,  basically anything.	40	3	10
317	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Playing as different breeds of dogs are awesome.	40	4	8
318	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	I'm pretty sure Jake's an American Foxhound.	40	5	7
319	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Anyway, the worlds are amazing.	40	6	5
320	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	They are very detailed.	40	7	4
321	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	The graphics could be so much better, but they're good enough.	40	8	11
322	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Sometimes I walk through people.	40	9	5
323	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Try to find this game used somewhere.	40	10	7
324	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Everyone will find a way to like this game, whether they like animals or not.My only concern with this game is the sound.	40	11	22
325	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	I don't know if it's my copy or what, but sometimes the characters say things at the wrong time.	40	12	19
326	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	"For example, after Jake got a bath he said ""Yuck!"	40	13	10
327	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	"I'm Filthy!"""	40	14	2
328	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Sometimes when I press the bark button  he doesn't bark, but his mouth moves.	40	15	14
329	B0002FQVEW	A1AYYCXEMY84I7	Video Games	6	Overall, this game is worth buying.	40	16	6
330	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	This is one of those games, hard to find, hard to stop playing.	41	1	13
331	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	It's truly interesting, playing the part of a dog who poops and farts.	41	2	13
332	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	lol It's not as bad as you might think.	41	3	9
333	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	Parent's don't worry, it's not a gross game.	41	4	8
334	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	It's really cute.	41	5	3
335	B0002FQVEW	AMA9A9WUNQDDE	Video Games	6	People of all ages will love being man's best friend, if only in a game.	41	6	15
339	B000ASDU40	A1L18EHEC52IRM	Video Games	6	This little device is perfect for PSP is you want the extra sound and just want to have a theater sound coming from two small speakers, these are for you, there small, combat stylish and good to walk with, i would recommend anyone in buying this for there PSP, and for $20.00 you can't ask for a better deal, fast shipping as usual, now i can watch my movie and not strain to hear it	43	1	74
340	B000ASDU40	A1S12A8FLNA0XD	Video Games	6	Worked Good Thanks!	44	1	3
341	B000ASDU40	A1S12A8FLNA0XD	Video Games	6	&#34;There is no fear where love exists.	44	2	7
342	B000ASDU40	A1S12A8FLNA0XD	Video Games	6	Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.&#34; 1 John 4:18	44	3	22
343	B000ASDU40	A15P89YSGBT3PP	Video Games	6	Poorly made broke on me in a few days of use and was not loud at all.	45	1	17
344	B000ASDU40	A73RRDW2WD38E	Video Games	6	this is an awesome idea, speakers work great but does not mount on the PSP1000, which it didn't mention in the ad.	46	1	21
345	B000ASDU40	A142ZT4PAZRQRW	Video Games	6	This is so kool and I listen to my music when I am taking a loooonnnngggg HOT bath.	47	1	18
346	B000ASDU40	A142ZT4PAZRQRW	Video Games	6	I love that I just ordered it on Monday and it was here on Tuesday that is fast and I will be back for more items from you.	47	2	28

351	B000HNJ5WE	A1WV8QBL2G5Y5G	Video Games	16	Great game it is fun and good.	49	1	7
352	B000HNJ5WE	A1WV8QBL2G5Y5G	Video Games	16	if you want kill zone 2 then get this game so you can get what the story is and all.	49	2	19
353	B000HNJ5WE	A1WV8QBL2G5Y5G	Video Games	16	its a great game for the PSP i recommend it.	49	3	10
354	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Forget what you have read previously...this game is NOT THAT difficult if you have any ounce of patience you will do well in this game (and this is coming form a person that DOES NOT consider himself to be a Hardcore gamer).	50	1	43
355	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	I will say however that it is challenging, which is exactly what I look for in a game, that and a high fun factor.	50	2	24
356	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	And man is this game fun.	50	3	6
357	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	I mean who wants a game they can beat or run through in one sitting?	50	4	15
358	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Onto to the review:Graphics: 5 out 0f 5 simply amazing I knew the PSP had it in her.	50	5	16
359	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Killzone in my opinion really push the graphics envelope.	50	6	9
360	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Graphically I can't honestly name another game that looks better.	50	7	10
361	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	The Birds eye view of the combat is great.	50	8	9
362	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	For you main characters to be so small in bird's eye view they hole a lot of detail.	50	9	18
363	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Games on the PSP can look amazing and this game proves it.Sound: 4.5 out 5 the game sounds great!!!	50	10	16
364	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	The voice over are well done!!	50	11	6
365	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Battle cries/sounds are wonderful.	50	12	3
366	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	To hear Rico shouting Obscenities and talking trash to the combatants can get old sometimes, but it is still more hilarious than tedious listening to him talk trash.Controls/Gameplay 4 out of 5 Okay this is where most people and even I ran into some issues with Killzone: L. But honestly there was more right than there was wrong with the controls and battle mechanics.	50	13	60
367	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Okay first the targeting system has the highest learning curve but once you have mastered it this game is a breeze.	50	14	21
368	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Your main character Capt Templar automatically targets any enemy that he is facing and in range.	50	15	16
369	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Holding the right shoulder button allows Templar to duck and cover, problem here, that I wish was different was that you cannot move while you are crouched (this did suck, but very easy to forgive).	50	16	36
370	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Holding the right and left shoulder buttons target an inanimate destroyable target (like fuel carrying barrels to destroy enemies.	50	17	19
371	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Also while ducking behind cover you can tap the shoot button if you are targeting an enemy and you will auto pop up to take shots at him.	50	18	28
372	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	This game throws a lot at you like spiderbombs, guys with rocket launchers and grenades, but all can be avoided with practice and a simple double tap of the left shoulder button.	50	19	32
373	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Overall the good definitely outweigh the bad, and you will become addicted to this style of Gameplay IF you take time to learn the controls, which unfortunately have a very high learning curve to some.Story (So Far) 3 out of 5, the story is really lacking though it is very simplistic and also indicates a KL2 in the future.	50	20	55
374	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	It doesn't suck but it is definitely not enough to keep a hardcore gamer interested, but luckily the addictive Gameplay makes up for it.Bottom Line: If you are looking for a challenging game, with good graphics and a style of gameplay that hasn't been done in awhile, probably since the first Metal Gear.	50	21	52
375	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	Then I highly recommend this game...once I got the hang of the controls I was addicted and could not stop playing it.	50	22	23
376	B000HNJ5WE	A3TS9IDXZMTOWW	Video Games	16	The campaign modes are not too short but not very long either and the bonus missions will test your skills for hours.	50	23	22
377	B000HNJ5WE	A32LUPQGHQQPGJ	Video Games	16	the PSP is limited by having only one analog stick, and PSP users know when playing FPS games it becomes so frustrating.	51	1	22
378	B000HNJ5WE	A32LUPQGHQQPGJ	Video Games	16	This game instead is a third person shooter, basically overhead, and the creators made this game as fun as it could be on the PSP.	51	2	25
379	B000HNJ5WE	A32LUPQGHQQPGJ	Video Games	16	you aim and shoot with the analog, you get grenades, a lot of weapons, after missions you are rewarded based on your performance and uncovering of veteran money, basically you use this to buy more cool weapons.	51	3	37
380	B000HNJ5WE	A32LUPQGHQQPGJ	Video Games	16	there are plenty of weapons, features, missions and they included an update to bring another act with several missions as a free bonus, plus they included an update for free online play.	51	4	32
381	B000HNJ5WE	A32LUPQGHQQPGJ	Video Games	16	a great package and a great PSP game with an entertaining story line, fun game play and rich graphics.	51	5	19
382	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	Let me first say, that I don't ever regret buying this game.	52	1	12
383	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	People complain about the weird 3rd person view, but I think that it beats even first person shooter view.	52	2	18
384	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	Especially on the PSP.	52	3	4
385	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	It is the perfect portable game.	52	4	6
386	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	"Missions are especially long, and it is a totally cool looking game to ""wow"" your friends!Right now, they are beta testing the ""Infrastructure"" mode for the game."	52	5	28
387	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	I am part of the Beta Test, and the online mode is even more fun than the single player!!	52	6	19
388	B000HNJ5WE	A3F3OZ1S2C3Y3Z	Video Games	16	You won't regret getting Killzone: Liberation!	52	7	6
389	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	This game is really fun.	53	1	5
390	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	I enjoy killing things on the go.	53	2	7
391	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	Sadly enough I have not played this for a long while.	53	3	11
392	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	Perhaps one day I'll get back into this game ..... then again, maybe not.	53	4	13
393	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	Only time will tell.	53	5	4
394	B000HNJ5WE	A1KKA1DPSXEH8C	Video Games	16	But it does have some really fun gameplay.	53	6	8
519	B000WJOZAK	A29KAWSTBD6M8I	Video Games	5	If you're looking for PC game with a great storyline, this ISN'T the game for you.	65	1	16
520	B000WJOZAK	A29KAWSTBD6M8I	Video Games	5	This is only fun for the gameplay and that's it.	65	2	10
521	B000WJOZAK	A29KAWSTBD6M8I	Video Games	5	The graphics are decent for next gen.PhysX card users unite!	65	3	9
522	B000WJOZAK	A29KAWSTBD6M8I	Video Games	5	This game supports PhysX, Ageia as well as Geforce accelerated!	65	4	10
523	B000WJOZAK	A29KAWSTBD6M8I	Video Games	5	Neat option in configuration, where you can choose the level of PhysX acceleration.	65	5	13
524	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	Shadowgrounds Survivor is a very simple game with some very good gameplay.	66	1	12
525	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	It consists of essentially run-and-gun tactics, with some minor shadow-induced frights.	66	2	9
526	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	The lighting engine is superb, although the shadows show heavy aliasing despite visual settings.	66	3	14
527	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	Weapons can be upgraded, as can character stats, using points earned from killing enemies.	66	4	14
528	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	However, getting these points is random, and you can feel like you should be using better weapons, but you can't unlock them.	66	5	22
529	B000WJOZAK	A10FKHGKWFXB74	Video Games	5	There are some technical issues, like some AI bugs and some sound problems that detract from the experience, but overall the game plays well, and is a fun way to kill a few hours.	66	6	34
530	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	At $5 I guess it's good for a couple of hours of mindless gaming, it beats watching paint dry.	67	1	18
531	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	At least it's short; 4 to 6 hours for the average gamer.As in the first shadowground, this seems like a throwback in gaming.	67	2	20
532	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	A top down 3rd person shooter with horrible voice acting.	67	3	9
533	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Felt like I was playing an arcade game circa 1985.	67	4	9
534	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Most cut scenes were incredibly boring and long.	67	5	8
535	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Example: you press 'e' to open a door, a long scene folows were your character walks slowly in an effeminate sort of way towards said door and opens it.	67	6	29
536	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	That's it, nothing is revealed, nothing happens, the cut scene ends and your wondering if you accidently hit the 'skip' key.	67	7	20
537	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Guess somebody's brother was in charge of cut scenes.	67	8	9
538	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	The controls seem to be even more clunky than the first Shadowgrounds.	67	9	12
539	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	In certain areas, when going around corners, the character would turn toward the corner rather than following the curser.	67	10	19
540	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	At first I thought my mouse skills were off but after playing a couple of 'survivor' rounds it became apparent that it was a flaw in the game.	67	11	27
541	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	A frustrating flaw when trying to shoot your way out of the undending horde of aliens this game supplies.	67	12	19
542	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Also the character would occaionally stop moving or get stuck for no apparent reason.	67	13	14
543	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	Not being able to save during a mission is another shortcoming, leave the game or die and you have to start over.Like the first Shadowground, if this game had been released 12 - 15 years ago it would rate 7/10.	67	14	35
544	B000WJOZAK	AKFK9B6UKA3HT	Video Games	5	As it stands, about on par with solitair	67	15	8
545	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	The Good: Easy enough for casual players, playing as different characters is fun, weapon upgrades make a differenceThe Bad: Bland environments, stupid story, bad level layout, boring aliens, slow paced, character upgrades are all the same, doesn't look very goodShadowgrounds was a pretty doesn't shooter a few years ago, but Survivor doesn't really do much new, and is pretty boring.	68	1	60
546	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	As a top down shooter you play as a marine who is trying to escape a ruined base that is overrun by aliens.	68	2	23
547	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	The weapons are pretty generic with shotguns, assault rifles, flamethrowers, grenades etc.	68	3	12
548	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	You can pick up health packs, ammo, and OK you know this formula already.Unlike other better shooters like Alien Shooter the game doesn't even offer intense moments.	68	4	26
549	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	There are a few straggling aliens coming after you and maybe a few hard ones, and that's it.	68	5	18
550	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	You can easily kill these guys and it doesn't feel very satisfying at all.	68	6	14
551	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	You can shoot barrels, toss grenades, or just run around holding the fire button and you'll beat these guys.	68	7	19
552	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	"Ammo is plentiful so you never feel like you're ""surviving"" and it's pretty hard to die.There is an upgrade system that you use by finding ""parts"" and when you level up you can use points for different upgrades like sonar, health boosts etc., and each character you play has the same upgrades?"	68	8	50
553	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	That's pretty lame.	68	9	3
554	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	While each character has a different load out there's just nothing exciting about it at all.	68	10	16
555	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	The game is fun however since it's good for more casual players who don't like the intensity of other top down shooters, but even the aliens are generic looking.	68	11	29
556	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	Instead of creepy deformed things you just get typical bug like aliens.The game doesn't look or sound too good either, and the music almost seems non existent while the game looks pretty bland.	68	12	32
557	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	The level design is also pretty bad since I wandered around areas and didn't know where to go like shooting a glass panel to open a walkway.	68	13	27
558	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	There is no hint, the panel doesn't even light up or flash.	68	14	12
559	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	So this is bad level design, and the whole freaking game just feels boring!	68	15	14
560	B000WJOZAK	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	5	The game is a little fun if you're bored or just want a decent top down shooter.	68	16	17
561	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	Following in the footsteps of the original 'Shadowgrounds' (a 3rd person shooter with RPG type upgrades), Frozenbyte has come up with this  sequel...Some points of interest; some good...1.	69	1	27
562	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)Good spooky atmosphere with excellent effects done with ambient lighting (especially from your flashlight), deep shadows and weather.	69	2	18
563	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	The audio is also quite good.2.	69	3	5
564	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)In this game you take turns being one of three fighters, each with their own skills and unique weapons; you choose one of the three  to use for the finale.3.	69	4	29
565	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)Each weapon has 3 major up-grades available (by using your hard earned XPs or finding hidden items within the maps); there are also a couple of minor player up-grades as well.4.	69	5	27
566	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)There is a Mech that you can operate in a couple scenarios, and a turret gun in another.5.	69	6	17
567	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)You have five lives for each segment; The first four deaths result in regeneration at the spot where you died.	69	7	20
568	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	With the 5th death, however, you restart the level (not the entire game).6.	69	8	12
569	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)There is another game mode that becomes unlocked with progress; it's called 'Survival' (and aptly named) .	69	9	15
570	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	In this mode you have one life, and you try for the highest score (kill count + time) in whatever amount of time you last.	69	10	24
571	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	This is a short, brutal game (I've gone longer that 4 minutes once), but kind of fun; in fact, probably more challenging than the actual game itself.	69	11	26
572	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	Again, as with the finale, you can choose any of the three 'heroes' for this mission.7.	69	12	14
573	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)A finale that is do-able (I found the ending in the original game was almost impossible, except on easy)And, the not so good...1.	69	13	23
574	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)The game is quite short; I finished it is less than 2 days of intermittent play.	69	14	15
575	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	Maybe 5+ hours in total.2.	69	15	3
576	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)Overall the game play, weapons and aliens were very similar to the original 'Shadowgrounds'.	69	16	13
577	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	Really very little new here.3.	69	17	4
578	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	)On visiting the 'Frozenbyte' website, it appears the game must be purchased (at least at this point in time)  through 'Steam' (that's where I got my copy).	69	18	25
579	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	I've had absolutely no problem with this or another other 'Steam' product I've purchased, but I realize some potential buyers  maybe put off with this.	69	19	24
580	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	I felt I needed to at least mention this for the sake of completeness.Conclusion:If you enjoyed the original, you will probably like this game.	69	20	24
581	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	It is, in my opinion, not as good as the original*, BUT, it is not bad.	69	21	16
582	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	Also, it's fairly short in actual playing time.	69	22	8
583	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	*after finishing this game, I went back and replayed some of the original game (to compare the two).	69	24	18
584	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	It seemed to me this game, although there were some tough areas, was much easier than the original.	69	25	18
585	B000WJOZAK	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	Video Games	5	It just didn't have the same persistent sense of urgency and tension that made you want to play on and on, like the first had.	69	26	25
586	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	There have been many Batman games but not many good ones, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the first game where you feel like Batman and you get to do all the things Batman can do, you really become the detective and caped crusader that is Batman.	70	1	45
587	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	This game really has a sence of darkness and the story line is perfect for this type of game.	70	2	19
588	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	If you are not sure about it then download the demo because if you dont try that you really are missing out on a great game.Plot: The game begins with Batman capturing the Joker after his latest plot and escorting him to Arkham Asylum for imprisonment.	70	3	45
589	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	Due to the Joker's recent attack on Gotham's Blackgate Prison, a large number of sane convicts have been transferred.	70	4	19
590	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	However, the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, frees all the inmates and closes Arkham Asylum with Batman and Commissioner Gordon inside.	70	5	23
591	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	Joker then threatens to detonate bombs all around Gotham if someone tries to enter the building.	70	6	16
592	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	Batman must uncover the full extent of the Joker's plan while contending with the horrors of Arkham and was not expecting much from the game because I had mixed feelings about the demo.	70	7	33
593	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	But as soon as I put the full game in, it freaking blew my away.	70	8	15
594	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	The graphics and presentation suddenly hit me when I began to play the intro of Arkham Asylum.	70	9	17
595	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	They made the visuals and it surroundings so believable that I thought I really had Batman in my grasp to controle.	70	10	21
596	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	It is obvious from the start that the developers put sweat and tears into the game.	70	11	16
597	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	Every chapter of Arkham Asylum is well thought out and realized.	70	12	11
598	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	The gadgets aren't just there for show, they make you use them because of the well crafted level design.	70	13	19
599	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	The free flow combat is great but if you can produce some combos and add some gadgets and moves into the mix, the hand to hand combat becomes even better.	70	14	30
600	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	"In conclusion, I will quote IGN by saying ""Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time."""	70	15	20
601	B001E8VB6O	A15LG7HS4WKKKS	Video Games	159	That is a bold statement but i truly believe that the game deserves it.	70	16	14
602	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	After 20 plus hours into the game I have to stop.	71	1	10
603	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	This game is highly repetitive.	71	2	5
604	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	If you like the kind of game that walks in the same area, one area lead to anther same hook up with multiple path, unlock doors after doors after doors without meaningful purpose, this is for you!	71	3	37
605	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	Another thing make this game sucks is no bat mobile, bat aircraft, motorcycle.	71	4	13
606	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	You stuck in an island with several building climbing in and out through the air vents, unlocks door with multiple rooms that often looks identical with several doors connection each other.	71	5	31
607	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	You will occasionally bump into thugs that are repetitive in nature that always require merely smashing square buttons to defeat.	71	6	20
608	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	Zero challenge, boring.	71	7	3
609	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	I wonder how you folks rate this game a five star?	71	8	11
610	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	Is that because you like the comics automatically make this a five star game?It makes me angry I bought this game base on the five stars review.	71	9	28
611	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	Next time think twice when you make a purchase base on review.	71	10	12
612	B001E8VB6O	A16CHJ8LZNIZ8S	Video Games	159	If you want to play a true game, pick up dark soul.Any body want this game, I mail it to you free...just give me five bucks to cover the postage and commute to post office.	71	11	35
613	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	This game is awesome, i have been waiting for it for a year and finally they release it.	72	1	18
614	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	All my expectations were met and loved every moment i played this game.	72	2	13
615	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	I would recommend you buy it if you havent bought it yet.	72	3	12
616	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	This game is great and worth the money.	72	4	8
617	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	The graphics are good and the gameplay is amazing.	72	5	9
618	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	You have Batmans entire arsonal of weapons at your disposal.	72	6	10
619	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	I mean everything can be used and the need for stealth and quickness is definitely apparent.	72	7	16
620	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	The game is funa and interesting from beginning to end.	72	8	10
621	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	If you want an adventurous game that you just cant put down then this is the game for you.	72	9	19
622	B001E8VB6O	A3NZBKAK7T3PE	Video Games	159	You wont want to quit even when its over.	72	10	9
623	B001E8VB6O	A1BHPNNG1ZAHE0	Video Games	159	Very satisfying gameplay.	73	1	3
624	B001E8VB6O	A1BHPNNG1ZAHE0	Video Games	159	When enemies are about to attack you get a slight warning, meaning if you can hit the counter button it shows an awesome counter move as you totally pummel the crap out of the guy, very very satisfying.However the best part for me is the STEALTH part.	73	2	46
625	B001E8VB6O	A1BHPNNG1ZAHE0	Video Games	159	If you are a fan of the Thief games, then you will really like this.	73	3	15
626	B001E8VB6O	A1BHPNNG1ZAHE0	Video Games	159	You can do all sorts of creeping around, hanging from rafters followed by silent take downs and then there is detective mode where you get an x-ray type vision mode.	73	4	29
627	B001E8VB6O	A1BHPNNG1ZAHE0	Video Games	159	I thought the part where you can track the alcoholic bad breath of that guard using your computer was cool.Overall this game is 10/10	73	5	22
628	B001E8VB6O	A1AFBLHAJXW2MS	Video Games	159	This game will definitely be in the list for Game of the year.	74	1	13
629	B001E8VB6O	A1AFBLHAJXW2MS	Video Games	159	This is a classic that no one must ignore.	74	2	9
630	B001E8VB6O	A1AFBLHAJXW2MS	Video Games	159	It is like playing a 5 star movie.	74	3	7
631	B001E8VB6O	A1AFBLHAJXW2MS	Video Games	159	Im not a big comic book fan but this game has made me a Batman fan.	74	4	16
2485	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	I've played this DJ game in on an arcade machine and I really like it.	229	1	15
2486	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	When I played the demo, I absolutely loved it.	229	2	9
2487	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	So I went ahead and purchased the full game.	229	3	9
2488	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	Here's the problem:1).	229	4	2
2489	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The demo had 5 or 6 songs (I'm sorry I don't remember the exact number because I deleted it after I got the full game.)	229	5	23
2490	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	and most of them are really nice English songs, including rock and rap I've never heard of.	229	6	17
2491	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	When I got the full game, I realized the VAST MAJORITY are Korean songs.	229	7	14
2492	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The demo songs are still in the full game, but what I'm trying to say is the demo was definitely not a fair representation of the full game.	229	8	28
2493	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	I honestly I felt like I've been cheated into buying the full game.	229	9	13
2494	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	This is borderline fraud.	229	10	4
2495	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	They picked the only 5% English songs in the full game into the demo to suck you into buying the remaining 95% Korean songs.	229	11	22
2496	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	But if you like K-pop, this wouldn't be an issue for you then.2).	229	12	11
2497	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The difficulty level.	229	13	3
2498	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The demo's difficulty was perfect.	229	14	5
2499	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	It was challenging but after a few tries, I really got the hang of it.	229	15	15
2500	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The full game has a RIDICULOUS difficulty level.	229	16	8
2501	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	I'm a dedicated gamer myself for decades and I understand challenges make the game more fun, but let me explain why I hate this one.	229	17	25
2502	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	In most other music games, there's a health bar and every time you press the wrong note or off key, you lose a bit of health.	229	18	26
2503	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	But in this one, you can lose the entire bar 3 seconds into the song if you press the wrong note.	229	19	20
2504	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	Or even if you can keep up for a while, a small simple mistake can cause you to die and the song will stop right away when it's just about to get to the best part.	229	20	36
2505	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	I find that very irritating  and too harsh.Other than the two problems I mentioned I above, the game was overall ok.	229	21	20
2506	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	The graphics are especially good.	229	22	5
2507	B00AMQMMEO	A153SJSPFMO0AW	Video Games	6	If you don't mind spend 5 hours trying to play through one Korean song, then I guess you will like this one.	229	23	21
2508	B00AMQMMEO	A1LLBSF024FIVK	Video Games	6	This game is just pure fun.	230	1	6
2509	B00AMQMMEO	A1LLBSF024FIVK	Video Games	6	I got it yesterday and save for sleeping, showering, and eating i have not put it down.	230	2	17
2510	B00AMQMMEO	A1LLBSF024FIVK	Video Games	6	The songs are very enjoyable, i have not found one that I don't like, and the gameplay is quite additctive.	230	3	20
2511	B00AMQMMEO	A1LLBSF024FIVK	Video Games	6	There will be times where I'll say &#34;Okay, one more song then I'm done for now.&#34; And then i go on to play about five more before putting my Vita down.Of course though my real only complaint with the game is the steep learning curve.	230	4	43
2512	B00AMQMMEO	A1LLBSF024FIVK	Video Games	6	The songs can be quite hard to get through, but that could just be the fact that I'm not very good at rythem games.I could go on and on about the games finer points, but I'm not very good at reviewing games so bottom line is i reccomend this game to anyone who likes rythem games or just happens to have a PS Vita laying around.	230	5	65
2513	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	This is a south korean game so expect K-pop.	231	1	8
2514	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	Its still fun even though some of the songs are laughable in content.	231	2	13
2515	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	It has 3 different challenge modes, the lowest setting gives you easier songs and less obsticles in the gameplay, next step adds more holds and the like to make it more difficult and the club mode is the hardest and gives you faster tempos and more notes, and its a much harder setting than the previous two.If you want a game that is difficult and challenging and might increase your reaction time by quite a bit this is a great choice.	231	3	79
2516	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	I was not dissapointed at all.	231	4	6
2517	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	Any fan of IIDX or Pop N Music will love this game, and ive spent more time playing it than almost any other vita game I own so far.	231	5	29
2518	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	I could have used more content, that is my only complaint.	231	6	11
2519	B00AMQMMEO	A3F90NNLT4KL4G	Video Games	6	Most of the songs are from previous DJMAX games (btw this is a series so if you are mad it has k pop all you had to do was read).Also I wanted to point out that it does have a health bar, it does fall rather quickly if you mess up repeatedly in a small section of time, so get better!	231	7	61
2520	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	The Good: Dozens of fantastic songs, great use of the touchscreen and rear pad, lots of stuff to unlockThe Bad: Not many modes, still no multiplayer, feels a bit too similar to PSP DJ Max gamesDJ Max was the best rhythm franchise on PSP and helps jump start that genre on Vita.	232	1	52
2521	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Technika is a reboot in a way but still feels familiar.	232	2	11
2522	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	The game uses the touch screen and rear pad exclusively ditching the button interface.	232	3	14
2523	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	This may take a while to get used to for DJ Max PSP vets like myself, but after a while you will see the difference in challenge and pace when playing.One thing I did notice right off the game is the continued lack of mulitplayer and modes.	232	4	46
2524	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	There is Star Mixing (3 songs using the touch screen), Pop Mixing (4 songs using front and rear), and Club Mixing (a choice of genres), and Freestyle.	232	5	25
2525	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	There&#8217;s the usual album which shows your wallpapers and unlocked videos but that&#8217;s it.	232	6	16
2526	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Why Pentavision insists on having no multiplayer is a mystery, but I&#8217;d like to have it in future installments.	232	7	20
2527	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Thankfully the game is packed full of songs featuring both licensed and original music from J and K pop to rock.	232	8	21
2528	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Kara is a huge appearance in the game since they are one of the biggest female KPop groups in Korea.	232	9	20
2529	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	They have 5 songs on here and they are fantastic, I actually listen to them outside of the game now.The songs still feature various DJs and mixing masters from previous games like ND Lee, NieN, and vocals by So Fly and various other Korean singers and rappers.	232	10	45
2530	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Getting into the gameplay, videos are now played full screen in the background and look gorgeous on the Vita&#8217;s screen.	232	11	21
2531	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Colorful dots are displayed and you must tap them to get Max 100% with the timing of the beat but there are long strands you have to hold down and follow the bar along the screen.	232	12	35
2532	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	The play field is split horizontally into two sections and you will be going back and forth between them.	232	13	19
2533	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Some notes require quick flicking of the touch screen as well and it all adds up to tense fun.	232	14	19
2534	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	The rear touchpad notes look different with purple and black borders around their notes requiring you to tap and hold.	232	15	20
2535	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	After a few hours you will get used to the system and slowly increase your difficulty.As you level up you will unlock equipment that gives you passive abilities like extra XP gain, HP, and even free breaks.	232	16	36
2536	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	There&#8217;s also an option to add a modifier to increase the speed of the notes coming in which is sadistic but it&#8217;s there.	232	17	25
2537	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Even after playing for a good 10 hours I&#8217;m still unlocking stuff and increasing my score.	232	18	16
2538	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	The songs are so great and fun to listen to that I can&#8217;t get enough of the game.	232	19	19
2539	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	If you loved previous games you must get this, anyone who hasn&#8217;t should jump in anyway.	232	20	17
2540	B00AMQMMEO	A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E	Video Games	6	Technika Tune is the best rhythm game on Vita right now and hopefully future installments will improve upon the franchise further.	232	21	21
2541	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Never heard of this game so never played the PSP versions.	233	1	11
2542	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	I bumped into it cause it was highlighted while browsing through the Playstation Store.	233	2	14
2543	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Everyone there gave it good ratings.	233	3	6
2544	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	I've pretty much played all the rhythm games for the consoles.	233	4	11
2545	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Theatrhythm Final Fantasy for the 3DS was the 1st touch screen rhythm game I've played for a console (portable or otherwise) in which I loved.	233	5	23
2546	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	I love upbeat music such as pop, dance, rave, trance, etc.	233	6	11
2547	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	so I decided to give this a try since my Vita was collecting dust.	233	7	14
2548	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Glad I did as I'm really enjoying this game.	233	8	9
2549	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Plays pretty much like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.	233	9	7
2550	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	With this it plays with split screen that alternates back and forth.	233	10	12
2551	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	The touch feature also uses the rear touchscreen.	233	11	8
2552	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	There is an option to turn that off if you don't like it.	233	12	13
2553	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	I also highly recommend playing this using nice headphones (I've used my Turtle Beach headsets) or speakers as it sounds so much better.	233	13	23
2554	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Great music, fun, nice back round vids... great game!	233	14	9
2555	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Every single website review I saw gave it a good rating.I couldn't find a physical US copy anywhere which was really odd.	233	15	21
2556	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	Guessing it's the demographic here.	233	16	5
2557	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	I didn't want to download it from the store due to my limited memory.	233	17	14
2558	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	They only place that carried it was their company website.	233	18	10
2559	B00AMQMMEO	A1OG3N2BYWTKR	Video Games	6	It's $49.99, with free priority shipping, which makes it currently the most expensive US Vita game.	233	19	15
2562	B00AQ6FSLY	A13UX3ONE34JJK	Video Games	5	Amazon bundled this with an online game code I bought for Christmas.	235	1	12
2563	B00AQ6FSLY	A13UX3ONE34JJK	Video Games	5	I played the game one time and haven't been back since.	235	2	11
2564	B00AQ6FSLY	A13UX3ONE34JJK	Video Games	5	That's not to say that this game was really bad per se, but it didn't really appeal to me as an older gamer.	235	3	23
2565	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	AirMech is an unique free to play game.	236	1	8
2566	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	Play against AI, Co-op, or versus.	236	2	5
2567	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	Paid items are cosmetic or speed up your leveling/point gain for unlocks.	236	3	11
2568	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	Rotates unlocked creeps and other upgrades LoL style.	236	4	8
2569	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	More fun with friends, but any online game is.	236	5	9
2570	B00AQ6FSLY	A2WOT193720BP5	Video Games	5	Think of this pack as a booster for new players wanting to get into the game.	236	6	16
2571	B00AQ6FSLY	A1B05INWIDZ74O	Video Games	5	This is a fast moving MOBA with a RTS aspect.	237	1	10
2572	B00AQ6FSLY	A1B05INWIDZ74O	Video Games	5	The gift Pack, which was a bonus gift for me, contained special skins for the Chopper and Striker AirMechs with some units I all ready had open and more.	237	2	29
2573	B00AQ6FSLY	A1B05INWIDZ74O	Video Games	5	The game itself is fast paced action.	237	3	7
2574	B00AQ6FSLY	A1B05INWIDZ74O	Video Games	5	And I love the fact the developers are active not only in the forums but in the game and listen too us; the players.	237	4	24
2575	B00AQ6FSLY	A1B05INWIDZ74O	Video Games	5	I have seen that they used the FTP model with micro transactions but they are not needed too play and win the game.	237	5	23
2576	B00AQ6FSLY	A2C0JSOR25OTAN	Video Games	5	I didn't like the skins very much and the bonuses only last for ten days of calendar time as opposed to game time, so if you're not playing, you lose out.The Christmas-themed achievements are pretty funny, though.	238	1	35
2577	B00AQ6FSLY	A1LFAGZ2MOXLHO	Video Games	5	This really nice game i really like it and i enjoy playing.	239	1	12
2578	B00AQ6FSLY	A1LFAGZ2MOXLHO	Video Games	5	I wish we could get more power ups in the beginning.	239	2	11
